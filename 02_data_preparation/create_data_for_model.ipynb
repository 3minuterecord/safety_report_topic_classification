looked loose they felt the tightness and determined it was finger tight the technician determined that the correct torqueshould have been298nm using a calibrated torque wrench the techniciantightened the bolt correctly they also did a sweep of the bolts on the rest of the valve and found that although they had obviously been torqued up a very slight amount of movement occurred on the majority of these boltslater discussions suggested that this may have been due to settling of the joint thermal issues or slightly different settingscalibration of the torque wrench within tolerance the engineering team conducted a full sweep of all joints as part of the original workpack nc16212p and cross checked with jims no further issues were found these checks were completed on the 26th and 27th july 2018the joint had been energized and inuse for over eleven months with no leak identified although the wood personnel that were identified through jims as being responsible for the original makeup had a 1to1 discussion with the engineering team lead the fact that no leak was identified suggests that the joint had in fact been disturbed although no evidence could be found within maximo to

running in tandem with sub contactor own investigation update twenty-two may 18the movement of scaffold material to and from sites is a normal part wgis operations as is the use of a subcontractor haulier jr adams have been a wgis sub contactor for several years and have in the last three years moved approximately twenty-eight thousand tonnes of scaffold material in around one thousand vehicle moves without incident the load being moved in this instance was routine and not regarded as out of the ordinary by either the haulier or wgis no special arrangements beyond normal operating procedures were required the site personnel and the driver had been involved with this type of load several times previously the vehicle was loaded using the onsite telehandler in the normal manner kickers were used to allow the telehandler to lower the bundled components onto the kickers which allow the telehandler tangs to be withdrawn the load consisted of bundles of tube packs of boards and stillages of smaller components such as fittings the load was positioned on the bed at the direction of the driver the load was then secured to the bed by ka using ratchet type straps which are typical for this type of load a total of fourteen straps were used the straps examined had a 5000kg rating when new ka reported that one of his straps securing the load had failed in transit which caused the load to shift and ultimately fall from the vehicle he did not know which one and had not kept it for examination once loaded the driver left site at approx one thousand, seven hundred and

vehicle then drove without incident from site along what would be the expected route towards the haulier depot in newcastle the driver did not make any stops between leaving ulverston and the location of the incident and as a result had not carried out any checks of his load security the route includes single and dual carriageway driving bends and three roundabouts the route takes the vehicle along

third exit which was at the three of the clock position the vehicle transited the roundabout as expected with no indication that the load was or becoming unsecure the driver exited the roundabout accelerating to join the a590 dual carriageway on the straight approach road he was positioned in the inside lane of the two lane approach road and was approximately half way between the roundabout and the dual carriageway when the lost load fell from the offside of the vehicle landing in the outside lane there were no other vehicles in the immediate vicinity at the time of the incident the driver immediately stopped on the approach road a number of motorists stopped to assist the driver recover the lost material that was blocking the road to allow them to continue on their journey thereafter ka recovered the load to his vehicle and secured it again ka used a significant number of straps to secure the now loose material to allow him to continue the recovery of the material back onto the vehicle took around four hours on completion the vehicle the driver had to park up for a rest period as he had insufficient driving hours remaining on his daily allowance the vehicle returned

crane and at that moment the pipe lifted at one end and came into contact with a cable tray directly above the spool thiscaused minor damage to the cable tray the movement was due to the slings on the spool notbeing in the exact position to level the load as may be expected when completing a trial lift unknown to the rigging operatives the pipe was held in place by a tack weld which the client agrees was a result of poor original fitting practice at the time of installation and very difficult for the riggers to see when they completed teir visual checks this tack weld had held the spool in place before breaking and freeing the spool to move suddenly the instrument cables and the multitube on the cable traywere running to an uncommissioned oil and water analyserwhich were isolated and

held following hose failure the location of the hose defect could not be identified at either metallurgical examination or subsequent testing and hence the failure mode could not be confirmed however since the hose had been successfully hydrotested at routine inspection in november two thousand and sixteen it is very likely that damage had occurred to the hose on site through handling storage or transportation the hose was seen to be in good condition following the failure and would not have been rejected by routine visual inspection it is therefore proposed that the population of cryogenic hoses are replaced on a three year cycle to reduce the likelihood of failure due to the accumulation of damage through use on site the investigation team has proposed modifications to reduce hose weight and to improve the hose storage facility in order to reduce the likelihood of incurring damage to hoses on site the enduring risk of hose failure can be eliminated at the metering streams by implementing modifications to hard pipe from the streams to flareclosed drains thereby avoiding the need for frequent cryogenic hose use at these locations see detailed description</td>\n","

initially thought that this was as a result of reduced flow of lube oil so the lube oil system was inspected it was found that the differential pressure across the filter was at around ten psi twice it is normal pressure indicating that the filter was suffering from a higher than normal resistance so was partially blocked mechanical technicians replaced the filters and the lube pump was run for several hours and remained at less than five psi indicating that the lube oil system was circulating properly on the next start on 19th june all indicated faults had been reset so no dormant fault remained on the system however soon after start up the temperature indications at the motor and generator drive end and nondrive end bearings were observed to be creeping up towards their alarm and trip points these temperatures were higher than would be expected under normal conditions so the ipp was shut down in a controlled manner on further investigation of the lube oil cooling system it was found that cooling water was not being circulated due to a closed control valve the impulse line to the pressure transmitter on the control loop was flushed through and the system was function tested and it was found that the valve responded correctly it is likely that either an airlock or debris ingress to the impulse line had partially blocked it after a period of three hours the lube oil
