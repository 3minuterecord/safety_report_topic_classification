primary because inadequate communication between different work groups the site leadership from different work groups did not adequately communicate andor take action to safeguard workers from critical work taskscorrective action app north chk operations team will identify safety critical points in well servicing operations that in addition to documented operating procedures will also require documented confirmation of the successful execution of critical steps this confirmation process will include at a minimum chk site supervision service company supervision and any onsite crew number that has authority over identified critical steps this confirmation process will be executed in the form of a scheduled safety focus break at any transitional periods between major work steps causal factor two infrequent activity the tool being tested in this case was a tool that is typically used to clear obstructions in a well bore it is not what would be considered normal for drill out operations the testing of a tool of this nature typically takes place in a suspended configuration attached to a workover pipe string in this case the tool was laid horizontally on a catwalk at the base of the rig and a kelly hose was attached between the tool and a pump corrective action when atypical work steps have been identified due to variations in work scope site leadership will be responsible for ensuring action is taken to safeguard workers from irregularities that may arise from executing those steps this safeguarding process will be executed in the form of an unscheduled safety focus break any time atypical work steps have been identified and will include at a minimum chk site supervision service company supervision and any onsite crew number that has authority over the work steps all changes in work scope and safeguarding measures will be documented on the crew jsa causal factor three pressurized equipment not secured personnel not isolated the tool was not

they noticed that the dannunzio was not operating eli stated at that time they went to the power box behind the unit he then noticed that the unit had no power going to it eli stated that through a investigation of the area they noticed that the 480v electrical line had a sharp bendkink to it and what appeared to him as a burn mark on the outside cover of the line at that point eli stopped the job and notified petrohunt company man wood group safety and eli direct supervisor upon arrival wood group and eli direct supervisor met with eli and austin and discussed the incident eli and austin covered the jsa before proceeding to the incident area safety was also advised by petrohunt company man and petrohunt electrician that he was to lock out the main breaker and that the electricians would be out in the morning to repair the line eli and austin then proceeded to show the incident area to safety and his supervisor safety took pictures of the area and began investigation of the area eli stated that the hydrovac had exposed both the electrical line that was struck and the gas sales line that comes off the well head of the dannunzio eli stated that he had the hydrovac run a twenty-five trench approximately three deep to find the electric line the initial locate company marked on the ground indicating the electric lines location but the hydrovac did not find it in that area this is why eli took it upon himself to tell the hydrovac crew to continue to hydrovac until it was found as he knew it ran across at some point in the area he was going to dig safety could see in the edges of the trench the hydrovac had exposed the electrical line located three down from ground level just wider than the trench width and that the depth of the hydrovac was about sixty-eight below the electrical line safety could see that there were bucket marks on the side of the ditch that shown that it was within the two foot allowable machine dig zone of the underground line eli stated that he was parked on the south side of the line while digging eli stated that he placed his bucket on the north side of the line and began to dig out the dirt under the line so that he could get the trench to the required six foot eli stated that he would place his bucket flat and pull his bucket on the ground towards his machine when the backhoe boom would get close to the electric line he would stop the motion and then curl the bucket up to help break the material up and drop falling dirt into the backhoe bucket eli then would lay bucket back flat on the floor of the trench and push it away from his machine so that he could place the dirt on the spoil pile once dirt had been pushed from under the line towards the machine eli then placed his bucket into the trench but on the south side of the line eli stated he placed the teeth on the bottom of the trench and began to pull toward the machine and when doing so would curl the bucket up so that the bucket would again become flat so he could continue to clean the ditch safety asked austin his role as spotter what he was watching austin stated that during the digging operations he was watching the front part of the bucket where

policies were not followed for digging near and around underground utilities policy states elkhorn policy we will not use mechanical means of excavation within twenty-four of any utility stop work authority was not taken as to prevent digging closer than two feet from the utility additional causes are pressure from oil company to finish the job each day which resulted in the crew trying

location mr voyles and mr griffin nustar were able to confirm the location of the boring with a tape measured off of the existing coastal water authority vault mr griffin also provided the following gps coordinates x twenty-nine six hundred and nineteen thousand, three hundred and fifty-three y ninety-five fifty thousand, five hundred and eighty-six which further confirmed the location after speaking with personnel onsite mr voyles also provided the following information the area has been barricaded and marked with caution tape personnel at the site had reached out to the surrounding plants and at that time no operators were aware of one of their pipelines in that location personnel at the site stated that the pfd did not get a positive gas reading on their monitors in conclusion based on the information available furgo drilling operation hit an obstruction approximately five five feet below grade and due to a hissing sound identified it appeared to be a line strike if this

stabilize the pipe and distribute its weight evenly over the pipe stands the pipe welder adjusted lowered the pipe stand positioned to support the flange at the end of the pipe this adjustment resulted in an uncontrolled shifting or rolling of the pipe which eventually left the pipe stand supports and fell approximately three feet to the concrete floor of the fabrication area in the process

process line as it should be presumed to be an original designinstallation error see photos the potential is classed a low as present due to the metal cladding acting as a physical barrier thus preventing direct exposure of the tie to the steam leak when the steam tracing line was pierced the steam tracing was isolated by the process team sabic investigationreview ongoing regarding potential to introduce adjustable drill stops and marking up of insulation where the close proximity of steam tracing lines to metal cladding locations may introduce a risk of disturbance prior to drilling

twenty-four two thousand and twenty-one update to potential severity full details in l2 report this incident was originally classified by the project in cairs potential severity rating selected was a c5 as although no personnel were injured the project belief is that it could have resulted in a serious injury to the operator andor potential fatality to the spotter located approximately twenty from the excavator at the time it is unlikely that any injury would have taken place to the operator of the excavator or nearby personnel in the area as the operator and spotter were aware of the overhead lines for an injury to have taken place either the excavator boom knuckle would have needed to contact the upper line seven thousand, two hundred volts at four feet above or nearly touch to provide a pathway to ground personnel the investigation team review determined that in this particular case the equipment boom height was such that it could only have struck the neutral wire and not reach the seven 2kv line this is a mitigating factor and there was not a high potential opportunity for multiple fatalities c5 or single fatality c4 the incident post eltirp was reclassified for potential as a2
