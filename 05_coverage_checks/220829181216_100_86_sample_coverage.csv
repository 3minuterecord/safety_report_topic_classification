(approx. 20 mtrs) both scaffolders looked below and saw the transom lying on the deck. both scaffs state that they never touched the far end coupler and that it must have been loose. they also claim to haveidentified a few loose fittings during the dismantle process. due to the size of the pontoon (20mtrs by 10 mtrs approx.)when the titan is in operation, the whole of the pontoon is deemed as a safe zone, with all ops with the exception of the banksman (who on this occasion was the barge master jp) returning to the steel container (welfare facilities). however on this occasion jp states that there were 5 ops on the pontoon out of the welfare unit at the time of the dropped tube. it is to be noted that the 5 ops were not in the area where the tube landed, however jp (banksman) states that the tube landed a few feet (approx. 5ft) away from where he was standing. jp stated that the tube deflected off the mewp (leaving a dent) before falling to the deck. jp was the only individual in the close proximity of the scaffold migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description",ORGP
