"back injury, vehicle incident general","joining instructions for compass point office (staines) migrated from legacy cairs incident #33848email for client 10/05/17on my arrival at heathrow last friday i followed the joining instructions provided by wood group:since i had some luggage to carry i chose to arrange a taxi to reduce my risks on 1. strain on back, 2. potential target for theft…. i arranged a taxi with staines cars and received some “vague instructions on how to meet them… something like meet them at the ground floor lift of the car park, but they would come to me if i called them”.anyway i didn’t worry about it too much because this is london heathrow.i arrived and there was no one waiting for me with a sign with my name at the arrival door… i proceed to the lift in the car park and could not find any car with a “staines” sign on it… i called them and they said they would be there in 15-20 minutes. i waited for 30 minutes as i roamed back and forth from the arrival door where pick up taxi reps were standing to the car park… after 30 minutes i called again and no answer… so i started to enquire about bus routes to staines. i was just starting to look for the bus pick up point when the security guard came running from the car park and told me a taxi with staines written on it had parked in the car park… after a quick check, i confirmed it was my taxi which was over 45 minutes late from the point of calling.on the way to the hotel i asked the taxi driver why they don’t wait inside the arrival hall with a sign showing the client’s name like all the other taxi services do… i was informed they had lost their license to pick up people from heathrow.on reflection i should have done more to make sure they would have been waiting at the arrival door with a sign to make this a less frustrating experience (and safer). however i would also expect wood group to regularly check their joining instructions and verify that the listed taxi services have licenses to pick up clients and will wait at the arrival door with client’s name.i have only highlighted above the hse concerns, but could write a much more extensive email on the all the additional risks i took on that day when i arrived and there was no one waiting at the arrival door with a sign. i.e. this isn’t a “benefit” which clients are looking for… it is a basic safety requirement for people who are not oriented to the environment and do not know how to get from point a to point b. for example we take business trips to london heathrow lightly but consider if waiting in a car park in houston or manilla which would have raised my risk profile significantly higher since it is very easy to be either mugged or even kidnapped in those locations.i trust wood group will take the necessary actions to review their joining instructions and ensure it is kept up to date on a regular basis. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description",ORGP
