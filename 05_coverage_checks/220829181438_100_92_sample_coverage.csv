"back injury, lifting or moving loads, vehicle incident general, excavations","power line stretched during excavation for storm drain excavator operator pulled concrete obstruction identified within a small trench excavation (intended for stormwater infrastructure installation).  the concrete obstruction appeared to be waste concrete materials from historic maintenance work at the facility.  in the process of pulling the concrete obstruction, a conduit containing 480v power conductors for the lime silo was stretched, resulting in a gfi trip to the lime silo junction box and subsequently resulting in power loss to the central treatment plant. previous locates did not identify this conductor.  the line was not marked, was buried at a depth of approximately 2 feet and contained no warning tape. the line was buried adjacent to the concrete obstruction. during the excavation process, the operator encountered a piece of concrete.  after ascertaining that the concrete did not contain duct banks, etc, he proceeded to remove the concrete obstruction.  teeth of the excavator struck the electrical conduit.  although the conductor itself was not contacted by the excavator teeth, the insulation was nicked and the conductors were pulled tight at the lime silo breaker.  the lime silo breaker tripped creating a ground faultwhich in turn tripped the main mcc breaker. electrician arrived on site at 1615 hours and repaired the damage by reinsulating the nicked electical wires and pulling slack back into the lime silo disconnect.  full power was restored at 1800 hours.there were no injuries as a result of this incident.a full safety stop was issued for all excavation operations at the site until the sr hse manager was able to investigate and close the incident.
