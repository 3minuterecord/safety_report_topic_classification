line of fire,"pipe rolled in the rack and damaged a scaffold pole (top rail). on 10/18/2018, at approximately 16:30, a piece of 30” heavy wall pipe with an elbow was set in the east west pipe rack.  the piece was a 44’3” section with a 90-degree elbow on the west side; this piece was laid to rest running east to west.  due to time constraints the pipe was not on the desired coordinates but was lashed down for the evening.the task resumed the following day.  the east end (shoe side) of the piece of pipe containing the elbow was placed on coordinates.  one of the pipe fitters was placed in position on a scaffold to ensure it stayed on coordinates while the west end containing the elbow was moved.  the foreman of the pipe crew wanted to move the west end 2” to the north.  the reason it was supposed to move to the north is that the straight run piece of pipe that was in the rack already was not on coordinates and had to move to the north and to the west several inches in both directions to be on the proper coordinates.the rigging used to pick the west end of the pipe would not be good for a choke hitch, so the rigger chose to basket the load.  as he was coming up on the load, the cribbing which the pipe was resting on was repositioned by the pipe department.  the cribbing was moved too far to the southeast.  as the cribbing was moved, some of it was removed which created a lower elevation for the pipe to rest on.  as the rigger had the crane cable the load down the cribbing was off-center causing the elbow to roll upward in the rigging slowly.the weight of the pipe (22,000 pounds) was set down and rested on the east side toprail of the scaffold which caused the top rail to bend.  no one was in the line of fire of the elbow as it moved.  the total load of the pipe was never completely released from the crane. work stopped and everyone was brought down out of the rack.  ineos showed up prior to being notified.  the pipe was brought to the ground and the area was made safe.  the scaffold builders did a thorough inspection of the scaffold and replaced the damaged top rail.",ORGP
