thousand and eighteen at around eight hundred and thirty hours a wood general assistant ga was asked by a wood mechanical technician mt to set up a two hundred and five litre drum of morlina oil so that it could be decanted into smaller twenty litre containers at approx one thousand, one hundred and thirty hours the ga positioned the drum on top of five vertically stacked wooden pallets approx 75cm from the ground and searched for the mt to come and undertake the task by one thousand, four hundred hours and with the ga being unable to contact the mt the ga decided to carry out the task alone in doing so he began decanting the morlina oil utilising gravity by positioning and angling the drum so facilitating easier oil flow through a funnel into a smaller container when there was approximately four thousand and fifty litres of morlina oil left in the drum the ga discovered that the oil appeared too thick to continue draining with just gravity in an attempt to force the remaining oil out of the drum the ga decided to connect a pressurised airline to the drum using the plant air system which is accessed approximately fifteen yards from the chemical laydown yard plant air pressure is approximately seven barafter turning on the plant air the ga reentered the chemical laydown yard area and observed that the oil drum was visibly bulging he rushed back to turn off the air supply at which point there was a loud bang the lid of the drum parted from the main body of the drum causing the remaining four thousand and fifty litres of morlina oil to escape and be sprayed over the chemical laydown yard the 400g air hose assembly fitting was discovered to have broken off and ejected from the drum the incident occurred at approximately one thousand, five hundred hours with the ga not in the immediate vicinity at the time there were no injuries to personnel an observation card was completed citing this as an oil leak the ga immediately began spill response alone using sobo cleaner and a fire hose to wash the spilled oil into the recognised bunded area oil drains system on hearing the bang the on duty process supervisor and members of the operations team searched for the source of the noise upon finding the employee in the chemical laydown yard they were informed that the oil drum had rolled off the pallet this was broadly accepted as there were high winds present on the day and the process team had a sense of relief that this noise had not emanated from a process safety related incident on friday 22nd june the mechanical supervisor ms visited the chemical laydown yard where it became apparent that there was more to the reported incident than first communicated as there was visible evidence of morlina oil on the walls and surrounding units of the chemical laydown yard on monday 25th june the site hse advisor asked the ga for a full statement of the event at which point it was first mentioned that pressurised air had been used this update

mechanical technicians replaced the filters and the lube pump was run for several hours and remained at less than five psi indicating that the lube oil system was circulating properlyon the next start on 19th june all indicated faults had been reset so no dormant fault remained on the system however soon after start up the temperature indications at the motor and generator drive end and nondrive end bearings were observed to be creeping up towards their alarm and trip points these temperatures were higher than would be expected under normal conditions so the ipp was shut down in a controlled manner on further investigation of the lube oil cooling system it was found that cooling water was not being circulated due to a closed control valvethe impulse line to the pressure transmitter on the

by a wood mechanical technician mt to set up a two hundred and five litre drum of morlina oil so that it could be decanted into smaller twenty litre containers at approx one thousand, one hundred and thirty hours the ga positioned the drum on top of five vertically stacked wooden pallets approx 75cm from the ground and searched for the mt to come and undertake the task by one thousand, four hundred hours and with the ga being unable to contact the mt the ga decided to carry out the task alone in doing so he began decanting the morlina oil utilising gravity by positioning and angling the drum so facilitating easier oil flow through a funnel into a smaller container when there was approximately four thousand and fifty litres of morlina oil left in the drum the ga discovered that the oil appeared too thick to continue draining with just gravity in an attempt to force the remaining oil out of the drum the ga decided to connect a pressurised airline to the drum using the plant air system which is accessed approximately fifteen yards from the chemical laydown yard plant air pressure is approximately seven barafter turning on the plant air the ga reentered the chemical laydown yard area and observed that the oil drum was visibly bulging he rushed back to turn off the air supply at which point there was a loud bang the lid of the drum parted from the main body of the drum causing the remaining four thousand and fifty litres of morlina oil to escape and be sprayed over the chemical laydown yard the 400g air hose assembly fitting was discovered to have broken off and ejected from the drum the incident occurred at approximately one thousand, five hundred hours with the ga not in the immediate vicinity at the time there were no injuries to personnel an observation card was completed citing this as an oil leak the ga immediately began spill response alone using sobo cleaner and a fire hose to wash the spilled oil into the recognised bunded area oil drains system on hearing the bang the on duty process supervisor and members of the operations team searched for the source of the noise upon finding the employee in the chemical laydown yard they were informed

process safety related incident on friday 22nd june the mechanical supervisor ms visited the chemical laydown yard where it became apparent that there was more to the reported incident than first communicated as there was visible evidence of morlina oil on the walls and surrounding units of the chemical laydown yard on monday 25th june the site hse advisor asked the ga for a full statement of

investigate the issuethe hvac engineer connected manifold gauges to check standing pressure within the system and found the system only had 2psi standing pressure it was apparent that the system had lost the majority of its charge he then carried out a visual check of the system for any signs of leakage and found oil traces on the discharge pipework suction pipework the side of the compressor the area was tested with a snoop to see if anything showed up with the remaining refrigerant charge it was identified there was a leak coming from the discharge pipework t piece this pipe had fractured most likely from vibration during normal operating conditionsdue to the indication of the leakage at 2psi it is estimated this unit has fractured the t piece within the last two weeks the unit is

hydraulic hose fittings on the top of the cranethe crane lifting operations were immediately stopped the lifting bridles were disconnected from the crane and the crane put safely into the rest and then shut down hydraulics isolated oil had ran down to the deck levels below stores level and process deck level which has been contained on deck by the deck crew utilising nearest spill kit to prevent any oil going to an open to sea drain on the process deck level hydraulic oil released was estimated to be three thousand and fifty litres which was contained on the platform on refilling the hpu tank this took thirty-five litres to fill back to the normal working levelclean up of the areas commenced and the hydraulic hose fitting investigatedit was discovered that the fitting on hose hum576 was loose and could be unscrewed by hand following the incident the internal rubber of ring seal was found to have parted inside the hydraulic fittingit is unsure at this time if the fitting was not fully tightened up during installation or if vibration has slackened back the fitting resulting in the release if it had been left slack during fitting this would have leaked beforethe quick actions of the crane operator and the deck crew allowed the crane to be shut down quickly and isolation valve to be closed to prevent further oil releasing from the systemall spill pads etc were cleaned up and the deck was cleaned to ensure no slipping hazard remainedthis has been deemed non reportable as it did not meet the reporting criteria referenced in hseprc1001 hydrocarbon leak
