weather related issue,"additional breathing air quality check not complete on setup migrated from legacy cairs incident #34508as part of the safe system of work for undertaking grit blasting activities additional checks of the air quality being supplied to the blast hood were not complete on initial set up. the system in use had a fully signed up written scheme of examination for the blast and equipment set up. immediate corrective action has been taken to assess all other similar set ups tor set by client: 1) is the procedure for testing of zander unit air quality specific in frequency, competence, test equipment, pass/fail criteria? 2) is the procedure fully understood by those signing off the blast set-up as safe to use? 3) are there record sheets for quality test results? 4) what are the occupational health limits for air quality delivered by zander unit and are these fully understood by all personal involved in blast unit set-up and usage? 5) are there medical tests for blasters who wear the blasting mask with air delivered by zander unit with usage levels per day? do we comply? 6) for the set-up in question with suspicion of the air quality being delivered , please provide an actual set of readings from the set-up and confirm these provide no threat to health confirmed by wg occupational health.executive summary the potential source of the respiratory chest infection is extremely difficult to pinpoint. but based on information from the air quality tests, the inspection of the filters, and lack of smell/odours/moisture within the blast hoodduring the work activity, it would seem unlikely that the compressed air system used during the blast activity would be the source, even with high moisture content. chest infections are usually caused by viruses and bacteria which are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, a compressed air system used for breathing air quality would not normally be considered a source of a respiratory chest infection. the chest infection reported by the blaster has been classified as not work related. to be classified as work related there has to be conclusive evidence that the injury or illness is directly linked to work activities – this has not been possible with any level of assurance in this case. whilst there has been no clear link identified between the blasting activity and the illness the opportunity has been taken to highlight improvements in the management of blast equipment setups and air quality testing on site.investigation findings and conclusions  1) is the procedure for testing of zander unit air quality specific in frequency, competence, test equipment, pass/fail criteria? procedure - yes, there is a wgis process for testing compressed air quality but it is not being implemented on site. this process for testing air quality is detailed within wgis procedure (sp24 respiratory protective equipment). frequency - breathing air quality checks should be carried out:- initial equipment set up – before first use, after a compressor has been changed out, after compressor maintenance, after a compressor has been moved even if it has only been moved a short distance, if an end user expresses any concerns, as a requirement of the job specific ra, where the quality of the breathing air is suspected as being below the required standard, where an item of the supply circuit such as hoses and filters has been changed out or repaired, client insistence, every 3 months. competence - air quality checks must be carried out by a competent person on set up. there was no one trained to use the test equipment on site. some air quality testing prior to december 2016 had been carried out by the wgis hse advisor but this task was not being carried out by anyone on site when he moved to another wgis contract. the paint team on site were aware that the previous hse advisor used to do these checks but no one from the paint team had raised any concerns that it was no longer being carried out since his departure. test equipment - the equipment used by wgis to test compressed air quality is the drager aerotest alpha. the test equipment was eventually found in the shell laboratory where it had been stored for an estimated 12 month period. wgis purchased a kit for mossmorran site in dec 2013 and it was issued to the advisor on site at that time. pass/fail criteria - breathing air quality is to meet the recommendations of bs en 12021.  contaminant maximum permitted levelcarbon monoxide (co)= 5 ppmcarbon dioxide (co2)= 500 ppmoil= 0.5 mg/m3water= 250 mg/m3odour / tasteno significant odour or taste 2) is the procedure fully understood by those signing off the blast set-up as safe to use? wgis have 5 employees on site who are trained and competent to set up and verify blast set ups as per the written scheme of examinations (wse). training was conducted on 11/06/2015, certified as being competent on site are kevin mcdougall, david simmonds, steven mcneish, lee thomson &amp; andy lambie. only these individuals sign off wse set ups. the wse procedure is in place to satisfy the requirements of the pressure systems safety regulations (pssr), and as such, focuses on the pressure elements of the set up. it does not currently include any requirement to conduct air quality checks as these requirements are detailed within sp24. the permit does not include any reference to air quality checks of compressed air. 3)are there record sheets for quality test results? as per wgis procedure sp24 records of air quality checks should be kept for 5 years. it is known that some air quality testing has been carried out prior to december 2016 but historical records of air quality checks could not be located during the investigation process. wgis form (qr128 compressed air breathing air quality check – aerotest alpha kit) should be used to record all checks. 4)what are the occupational health limits for air quality delivered by zander unit and are these fully understood by all personal involved in blast unit set-up and usage? all personnel involved are aware how the niltox filters work. the niltox purifiers are contained in sealed cartridges and contain the colour change monitor, these are monitored by the site team. no concerns were raised by the site team about the condition of the filters in use. 5)are there medical tests for blasters who wear the blasting mask with air delivered by zander unit with usage levels per day? do we comply? medical tests for blasters are conducted at site annually. the blaster has completed a site medical at mossmorran on 30th march 2017, during the medical the blaster had a lung function test carried out. results were poor though not significantly different from 2015. on the blasters completed occupational health questionnaire he had indicated that he had suffered from pneumonia within the last 3 years . following the assessment, the nurse did not advise for any adjustments to be made to the blasters role and he is presently deemed fit to wear an air fed blast hood. there are no specified usage levels per day for blasters wearing air fed blast hoods. the blasters are advised to alter their work rate according to their own capabilities, rest periods during blasting are taken as per the blasters requirements. this is monitored and enforced by supervision. 6)for the set-up in question with suspicion of the air quality being delivered, please provide an actual set of readings from the set-up and confirm these provide no threat to health confirmed by wg occupational health. when the blast activities were being undertaken on 17th &amp; 18th august 2017 the blaster did not report any issues or concerns relating to excessive moisture, water or smells within his blast hood. he completed the task on both days without stopping work or raising any concerns about the breathing air being provided. an air quality test of the set up being used could not be undertaken in its exact location (t-3401 area) due to elapsed time from the blasting activity being undertaken (17th &amp; 18th august 2017), and the blaster reporting his chest infection (24th august). the equipment by thursday 24th august had been dismantled and taken away from the t-3401 area. in order to get a comparable air quality test the exact same equipment was set up in the yard at silverstone stores. a test was conducted on monday 28th august. these tests confirmed that, carbon monoxide (co), carbon dioxide (co2) and oil mist were below the recommended levels, confirming air being provided through the equipment and filter unit being used was not potentially contaminated. it is difficult to ascertain the exact water vapour level from the test conducted on monday 28th august as the wrong drager tube was used for testing. drager tube: water vapour 1/b (part no. 81 01 781) was used instead of drager tube: water vapour 20/a-p (part no. 81 03 061). the tube during the test went off the scale within 2 minutes but this was due to the wrong tube being used. a visual inspection of the filters confirmed that the colour change strips were within the recommended scale for safe use (one had a full blue line and the other had some pink discolouration below the recommended change line). there were no unusual odours, mould or growth evident on any of the filters. there was some indication of potential slight contamination (oil or moisture) on the tip of the colour change strips, but this is not unusual. a wgis occupational hygienist consulted during the investigation states that the presence of moisture within a compressed line for breathing air quality does not represent an immediate risk to health, whereas the presence of co, co2 or oil mist above certain levels would. the wgis occupational hygienist stated that moisture is more of an issue operationally e.g. moisture in a line can lead to issues with freezing (if certain temperatures are reached), which could in certain conditions lead to line fractures and thus loss of air. moisture also has the potential for rust to occur. so a visual check at major connections points, threads, tappings, inside filters cartridges would indicate if rust was occurring. excessive moisture/condensation can lead to microbiological growth, if conditions are good (e.g. correct temperature, food availability etc). this would be rare within a compressed air system though and would be more relevant with standing water. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description",ORGP,3
