The supervisor recognized a new worker, SSW, in his team that was available and he asked to the worker whether he was capable to operate the equipment, worker gave a positive response. Supervisor than directed the SSW to drive to the defined location accompanied by a SSM spotter. Once arrived at location machine operator, spotter and Supervisor had a \"brief\" Start Work Meeting just generally discussing the work to be performed. During the activities the spotter was focusing on having proper barricades on the areas and to keep other personnel out of the area the machine operating area.During the compaction operation the operator was approaching the sloped part frontally until he took a short cut to change to the compacting away from the slope. While trying to make a turn the operator realized he was too close to the edge. Therefore he decided to come to a complete stop, machine place in neutral, and unbuckled to visually check how far he was from the slope. While looking the operator realized the machine was actually above the slope and the soil started give away, at this point the operator rapidly descended \"jumped\" off the machine on the opposite side from the sliding direction. The machine continued sliding on the inclined sloped and once reached bottom of slope sideways causing the machine to tilt over.

       "      <td>The survey team arrived on site on Monday the 18th January we were given a health and safety briefing.  As anticipated, and in accordance with the Amec FW Risk Assessment, the induction provided advice in relation to ordnance that they might encounter while working on site. The security guard delivering the briefing indicated that the likelihood of encountering anything was low, and anything we discovered would almost certainly not be live.  It was, however, made clear to us that we should not get close to any ordnance/suspicious objects, and should report anything we found to the guards.  We were shown a selection of photographs to illustrate the types of items we might see.  A member of the survey team specifically asked if there were any ‘no-go’ areas that were dangerous, and was told that the entire site had been swept for ordnance, and there were no ‘no-go’ areas. During badger surveys I found several items within Site A (Training Area) which I mapped on our paper plans, and in line with the instruction provided during the induction I told the guards. One of the guards came to label the ordnance with hazard tape and canes, and took photographs of their locations.  They were told that these were smoke grenades and pyrotechnics –mostly casing and spent canisters- used for training purposes. The guard informed us that a team of military ordnance experts would be coming to site at some point and that they could assess the ordnance as part of training exercises.  He did, however, tell us not to return to these areas, and marked them off with red and white hazard tape.  We informed the rest of the survey team to avoid the taped off areas. Further items were found on Tuesday and Wednesday, and we continued to map them and let the guards know.  Another colleague also noted items and informed the guards of their locations. The guards continued to label the ordnance, but at no point indicated it was unsafe to continue our survey work. On Thursday, two additional member of the survey team arrived at the site to meet with the Principal Consultant already on site.  They both attended the site induction, and the Principal Consultant sat in on this.  The security guards on duty had switched, and a different guard delivered the induction material.  This guard delivered the information in a completely different way, emphasising the danger of unexploded ordnance and photographs of land mines etc.  The Principal Consultant became very alarmed at this, and asked whether or not it was safe to be carrying out ecological surveys across the site, considering these involve walking through dense vegetation where a clear search of the ground might not be possible.  The guard maintained that there was a real risk that there could be unexploded ordnance on the site and that no-one knows what dangerous items may be hidden in the grass.  At this stage, the Principal Consultant contacted all surveyors and instructed them to remain on hard surface areas and ground where a clear and full visual assessment can be made until further notice – i.e. do not enter dense scrub or tall grass areas. I continued to work as instructed, and did not enter dense vegetation, but looked into it from paths/roads. On Friday, The Principal Consultant managed to contact the project manager to explain the situation and ask that the client provide clearer advice regarding the ordnance risk on the site and which areas were genuinely safe to enter.  PM explained that, the site manager, would be the appropriate person to discuss the issue with.  The Principal Consultant contacted the Site Manager to set up a meeting on site (25th Jan).  She also called the Technical Director to explain the situation.  He called the client, and then came back to the Principal Consultant to advise that the Site Manager might not be the appropriate person to speak to, but the advice would be sought from the expert ordnance team within the MOD.  The Principal Consultant retained the meeting with the Site Manager anyway, given that she needed to speak to him about other site access issues as well.</td>\n",

They collected a key from the Lodge Hill security guards to enable them to open a road barrier and drive down to the ponds.  The site is publicly accessible by foot, but not by vehicle without a key.Shortly after they passed through the barrier they were flagged down by five male youths (aged approx. 18 - 21) who were walking their dog along the road.  The dog, which was a Pit Bull type, was off lead.  The surveyors stopped, wound the window down slightly and asked the youths if they were ok.  The youths laughed and claimed they were 'just practicing manoeuvres'.  As the youths were clearly acting foolishly the surveyors drove away and carried on to their survey ponds.  The survey ponds were located within a large sheep grazed field a considerable distance along the road.  The field is accessed via a gate and the surveyors parked their car adjacent to the gate.After approximately 30 minutes, whilst the surveyors were setting up bottle traps, the youths and their dog appeared in the corner of the field, climbed over the gate and were loitering around the car.  The surveyors felt uneasy about the situation and were concerned the youths may damage or break into the car.  They did not feel comfortable walking back to the car whilst the youths were present, so they called the security guards at the Lodge Hill Guardhouse to request assistance.  The security guards informed the surveyors that they would be unable to help as they did not have a spare key.Thankfully the youths moved on and the surveyors were able to return to the car once they had completed their survey.  However, this has highlighted that having only one set of keys is a significant concern.  In an emergency situation, the emergency services would be unable to gain access because there are no spare keys at the guardhouse.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On the morning of the 15th August 2017 inside Building B177, level 110 the electrical subcontractor had the task to install cable tray.  A job start took place with the electrical supervisor and two electricians.  The task at hand was given to the electricians to erect an aluminum scaffold tower. At some point that morning a conversation took place with the electricians and a clients representative.  The conversation was in regards to the erection of the scaffold (was there a Client Life Saving Rule (LSR) violation) e.g. was fall protection required.  The clients representative then asked for the PTW issuers opinion, he was unsure and called for the scaffold charge hand.  The charge-hand identified that there were a couple of scaffold tubes (handrails) incorrectly fitted and the whole tower was leveled incorrectly.  He made the adjustments to correct this.  The charge-hand then asked the question to the electricians \"are you trained to do the task\".  The electricians stated that they were not trained to erect aluminum scaffold towers.   Charge hand informed the electricians they should not be erecting the scaffold tower and would see his supervisor in regards to getting a scaffold crew to erect the tower or erect a tube and fitting scaffold.Scaffold charge-hand and his supervisor returned with the electrical supervisor to try and resolve erecting the scaffold tower.  The electrical supervisor informed the scaffold supervisor what the purpose of the tower was to be used for (installing cable tray/supports).  Scaffold supervisor informed that the tower would be inadequate and a tube and fitting scaffold would be the better option.  This was left with the electrical supervisor to follow procedure in requesting a tube and fitting scaffold to be erected.The following morning the clients representative noticed that the aluminum tower was fully erected (not tagged).  An inspection took place with the outcome of the tower being erected incorrectly.  It was also noted the way the scaffold was erected there was the potential for an LSR violation.</td>\n",

All excavation procedures were followed, and additional precautions were taken to expose the water line in question by soft digging. The encountered electrical line was not identified by 811, client drawings or in nearby electrical panels. The electrical line was uncovered trying to determine the direction of the waterline. After further investigation conducted by the Power &amp; Process Director of Electrical Services, the incident was confirmed as a B3 due to the following information:1.\\tAs the conduit was exposed it disconnected from the breaker panel resulting in no energy exposure2.\\tThere were no spotters in the near vicinity of the bucket location3.\\tThe power source was limited to two separate 110v lines</td>\n",

The driver reported that his vision had become impaired due to the low winters sun shining into the cab as he reversed.  A banksman positioned towards the front and side of the reversing vehicle did not appreciate how close the ISO container was to the rear of the skip and the skip struck the container resulting in a 30cm puncture hole to the side of the container.  The skip and skip vehicle were undamaged.  No injuries were sustained.  The vehicle movements were being carried out in a fenced off area with restricted/controlled access and at slow speed.</td>\n",

While scoping out, the operator had to extend cable to both the headache ball (secondary line) and the main hoist block to allow the boom to scope out. The main hoist block had 14 parts of line and did not weigh enough to prevent equalization between the weight of the block and the line running along the length of the boom which allowed the cable to “birdcage” (unravel some) on the cable drum. This caused damage to the cable. The job was stopped, and the cable was spooled out enough to try to inspect to see if it could be re-spooled on the drum, but the cable was damaged too badly.

The courier was then observed getting back into his parked vehicle outside of the site compound and left the area.The MW operator did not have the opportunity to intervene due to the distance she observed the security breach.Upon review of CCTV footage from the control room and as attached to this incident, the courier walked in front of cars waiting in the queue as per the video to drop off the boxes.The Vendor Management Coordinator was notified and subsequently made enquiries with the supplier (Haymans) who then reiterated the site access requirements to the courier (Jet Couriers).Jet Couriers informed Hayman’s that the courier was new and was ‘on trial’.

Equipment involved was a John Deere 410 articulating off road haul truck.  During the operation per typical procedure the truck was be loaded in the bottom of the large ditch/swale and then pulled forward out of the swale that was a 4-1 slope.  As the operator exited the ditch on an angle the truck bogged down and attempted to automatically switch gears and stalled stopping momentum.  This caused the load to shift and put extra wight on the downhill side of the truck causing the truck to partially roll onto its side per the articulating design.  With the employee donning their seat-belt there was no injury and the machine sustained minor damage to the cab and fender.</td>\n",

       "      <td>About 1815 hrs on Wednesday 24/04/2019, a security guard attended at the stores at SAGE to carry out his normal evening task of charging the BM25gas monitors. On checking the battery status before disconnecting the BM25, he found one of the devices was not charging, even though it was connected to the charger. On visually checking the connection, he saw that the rear part of the connecting male end of the charger, was not housed correctlyinto the front end of itself. He proceeded to remove the charger by unscrewing the end part of the charger, which had been screwed into the BM25 monitor. Once this had been unscrewed, he proceeded to remove the charging end of the charger, and at this point the rear end of the charger parted company from the front rotating end, giving off a small spark and a very slight nip to his finger. He took a closer look at the charging unit visually, and saw that there were two bare exposed wires coming out from the rear part ofthe connecting end. He disconnected the charging end of the charger from the power supply to make it safe. He then labelled the relevant part and placed it for the store mans office for his attention. The security guard returned to the gatehouse, and reported the incident to his supervisor and completed an observation card. Although slightly shocked by the sudden spark, the security guard was uninjured and no treatment was administered. It is understood that this incident had reached its full potential given the source of the spark was from a low voltage battery unit.</td>\n",

Pumping down the system holding tank caused the bag filters to be more clogged than usual, and thus they did not drain water and were too heavy/under too much suction to be removed without removing the bag filter. As a result, the changeout involved lifting filter screens from the unit and removing the bag filters from the screen. IP was lifting out the screen from the unit and setting it on the top before tipping the screen over to drain the water and then remove the filter. When the screen was tipped over, it slipped out of IPs hand. IP attempted to grab the screen before it fell off the unit. In the attempt, IP's finger was caught between the screen and the unit, and the force caused a cut on the finger. Nitrile gloves were being worn at the time.</td>\n",

None of the containers inside the large boxes were labelled).  A pH test was carried out initially by a project Engineer with litmus paper which showed the liquid was alkaline around pH 10 to12. A subsequent test was carried out using the equipment in the MCLR by Senior Chemist, which gave a more accurate reading of pH 10.9. This is believed to be because it was in contact with the concrete. It took some time to identify who owned the containers. Once we did they were immediately contacted and asked to attend.They advised that the leaking liquid was water. The liquid in the flexible containers was also water, and the other containers held sludge and crust from site.

The driver also stated he was keeping left to give himself the best advantage of visibility for the upcoming bends (driver is advanced trained – AWAITING PROOF OF THIS). The WOOD driver claims that he observed an oncoming driver, driving centrally to the road, driving much faster than he was. When the oncoming driver realised she was driving excessively for the road conditions she braked heavily which caused her vehicle to skid forwards without control (Supported by police).  This action caused the WOOD driver to go further to the left of the road forcing him into a verge. The WOOD drivers van was prevented from toppling over entirely, by virtue of trees and bushes. The oncoming vehicle had made impact with the WOOD vehicle but not a ‘full-on’ impact. The impact was more conducive to a glancing blow (as indicated by the pictures). The oncoming vehicle proceeded to end up in a verge on the opposite side of the road. The WOOD driver got out of the van and proceeded to walk over to the other driver, to see if they were ok. Both drivers were able to get out of their respective vehicles but the oncoming vehicle driver had complained of some minor pain. The WOOD driver has declared no physical injury or deterioration of health since the injury. The WOOD driver declared no need for hospitalisation. Both drivers proceeded to make a series of phone calls with the WOOD driver calling;•\\tPolice @ 0750•\\tOps manager @ 0800The police arrived at approximately 0820 who proceeded to breathalyse, and check driving and insurance details. Both driver passed all checks. (The WOOD driver had submitted the relevant details and pre-requisite driving criteria to enable him to drive on the behalf of the OLEFINS 6 2020 SABIC TAR).The police took statements from both drivers with the oncoming vehicle driver, admitting fault. The WOOD driver did not accept any liability. This information was recorded by the police. (The police report will be followed up in due course to try and obtain a copy).@0900 -         The Material Engineer for WOOD went to the scene of the incident and collected the WOOD driver. Photographs were taken at this point and the Fleet Manager in TVC contacted for guidance on the stranded vehicle. The vehicle was moved to a safer location soon after, due to the precarious position both vehicles were in. @ 1130 -         The vehicle recovery team arranged through Nationwide took the van to a depot in Durham. If you have any further questions please ask, but bear in mind the investigation is now underway and further information will be cascaded in a more comprehensive manner, in due course. At this stage and given the statements and visual evidence. The resulting indicators dictate that the behaviours and conduct of the WOOD driver were compliant. From the initial statement of the driver it would appear that he has done everything he could to behave correctly with the highway code and wood driving policy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Around 23:30 hours the Plant subcontractor was moving the overhead crane south over the unit 4 crane bay.  Wood's Broderson was set up over the unit 4 crane bay and was unoccupied and on standby.  The plant overhead crane (operated by plant subcontractor) made contact with the Broderson's boom.  The Wood operator was not present in the cab of the Broderson at the time of contact.  Detailed Description: Wood employees were told that they were going to have to move the Broderson in order for a plant subcontractor to relocate the Stator Cover of the Generator to the Northeast corner of unit 4 turbine at approximately 21:00.  At that point, the Wood operator and the employees working in the area were told that they did not need to move the Broderson, only to retract the boom and boom down, which was completed prior to 21:00. Once the piece had been flown around the South end of the Unit 4 active turbine and relocated beyond the Broderson, the guys went back to work. During this time, the overhead crane remained idle for approximately 1.5-2 hours. At 23:00 the Wood operator left the Broderson to use the restroom. The boom was left elevated in anticipation of picking another load of demo material.  During this time, Wood employees on the operating floor receiving the loads were inside of the red barricade looking into the bay to the basement on the South side of the Broderson.  The plant subcontractor then began moving the overhead crane and did not make an attempt to alert the Wood employees in the area that they were moving the overhead again. The operator of the overhead crane and two other coworkers were located on the north side of the hook and Broderson.  As the plant subcontractor moved the overhead to the south, the operators cab of the overhead made contact with the tip of the Broderson's boom.  From the verbal statement given by the plant subcontractor operator, the boom height would clear the overhead crane; however, the lateral distance of the boom tip did not clear the cab of the overhead crane.  Thus, resulting in the Wood Broderson being pushed approximately 4’ from its original location, into the toe plate. \\t</td>\n",

       "      <td>A heavy piece of metal (approx. 85kg) was being transported to a workbench in a small crane by a group of workers inside of pipe-shop 1. Upon completion of the movement to position the equipment aside the workbench and transfer the metal piece, the inertia of this movement caused the piece to oscillate out of the crane basis' gravity center, causing the crane to tip over. The IP was participating on the piece transportation and when the crane fall occurs, he attempted to stop the crane felling movement by using both of his hands above the head. As he could not hold the crane felling over, one of the crane's legs hit the IP left leg from the bottom up, pressing his knee against the workbench, causing a bruise on the knee and a small cut on the back of the leg. The metal piece detached from the retaining strap and fell to the floor, falling apart in two pieces. A nearby worker tried to get out of the way and hit a nearby Argon cylinder strapped into a rack and the rack+cylinder fell over, not injuring anyone else, but with potential for worse damages.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On Wednesday the 7th October, two employees from the waste management contractor (WMC) were working at ground level on the west side of the reactors on the AN Plant.  They were situated approx. 8 metres from an enclosed scaffolded area, which was erected to support hoses to transport catalyst from a hopper to the drumming equipment. At approximately 10.40am, the WMC employees reported that they heard “a loud metal noise, then a loud noise of something hitting the scaffolding platform supporting the hoses, then a noise of an object hitting the ground”.  On inspection of the enclosed area the operatives observed a large nut on the ground. The WMC operatives moved away from the drumming area and reported the incident to their supervisor, who informed the duty Shift Manager. At the time of the incident three Wood Mechanical Fitters were working on the 36” B Reactor Effluent Cooler inlet line transition spool which is located Around 23 metres above grade. To enable safe access to this spool a scaffold working platform had been erected, as part of the spool extended over the handrail.  On inspection it was observed that the scaffold platform had openings of 22.5cm x 10cm on the east and west of the spool where the handrail supports protruded through the platform. The openings were big enough to allow a nut to fall to grade. It is not common practice on the INEOS site to plywood over gaps in scaffolding.On the morning of the incident the Wood Mechanical Fitters were tasked to remove around 60 bolts which have a nut on each end. Each bolt / nut unit is 270mm in length and weighs 2.9kg. Each nut weighs 0.5 kg and is 60 mm AF. The nuts were removed using two Rad guns (pneumatic and battery).  One Mechanical fitter was working on the east side of the spool and one on the west side due to restricted working arrangements. Once removed, the bolt / nuts were placed on the scaffold, where the third Mechanical Fitter replaced the removed nut on to the bolt and stacked the complete unit on the steel Kennedy grating ready to be brought to grade. Once the job was complete, the working party moved to another work location situated three levels above. It was on this second job, at around 11.30am, the duty Shift Manager arrived and informed them that a nut had dropped to grade from their previous location and requested them to cease work. Inspection of the stacked bolt / nut units had shown that one of the bolts possessed a single nut.  All three Mechanical Fitters were unaware that a nut had fallen to grade and each stated they would have stopped the job if they had known. In the interview with the Fitters the question was asked why a bolt with only one nut was not spotted.No POWRA was completed before the task was carried out which may have alerted them that there were openings in the scaffold.The area below the openings has pipe work and a gantry level below on investigating the area where the nut landed there is no obvious signs of impact. The incident happened at 10.45 and was reported to the wood on site HSE Advisor at 13.30</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #28667BackgroundA maintenance order was placed for the upgrade of the sewer system at the LNGP Dog Kennels. WGPSN were contracted to decommission the existing septic tank and install, tie in and commission a new engineered solution. Installation of the tank requires a benched excavation approximately 15m long x 10m wide x 3m deep. Approximately one week prior to starting this project, WGPSN together with EMPNG Maintenance discussed the constructability of the project which included the possibility of finding unexploded ordnance (UXO) during the excavation phase. The available LNGP UXO Protocol states; “A UXO survey must be completed at EMPNG work locations not yet surveyed for UXO prior to any excavation or ground disturbance activity. Limitations of the detection technology must be considered e.g. how deep the scanner can detect, conditions that may affect its ability to detect etc”. In relation to the above requirement, work planning were aware of a UXO Survey conducted by RPS Energy on behalf of ExxonMobil in August 2008. On review of the final report and the final clearance map, it was agreed between WGPSN and EMPNG Maintenance that the Dog kennels area was a part of that survey and determined clear of UXO. However, it was unknown at the time by WGPSN and EMPNG Maintenance that a decision had been made by EMPNG that the UXO Survey conducted in 2008 was deemed to be null and void due to chance UXO finds post survey completion. On the evening prior to the incident , the WGPSN Construction Coordinator and Supervisors held their daily 1730 planning meeting. The Dog Kennel project was discussed, along with the requirement to scan for potential underground services prior to excavation. Service scanning equipment from the warehouse consisted of a cable scanner and a metal detector with the metal detector capable of scanning to a maximum depth of 6 inches (although the operator believed that the detector was suitable for scanning to a depth of 6m). All personnel involved with the excavation task have completed the UXO Training Package. This is delivered as part of the WGPSN Site Induction. Incident DetailsOn the day of the incident at 0600, the Construction Coordinator held the morning prestart meeting with supervision and the workgroups. The supervisors with their work crews split up into groups and discussed works for the day. The Critical Permit to Work for Excavation / Ground Disturbance 00026896 was taken live at 0641 however this was not required until excavation works were to begin in the afternoon. During the morning, the Dog Kennel workgroup namely the Supervisor, Foreman, Excavator / Backhoe Operator and Machine Spotter arrived at the work location. They reviewed the work area and discussed the plan for the day. The JSA for the works was reviewed then the crew moved ahead with pegging and marking out the excavation area. The crew then waited for the underground service scanner (Electrician) to arrive. Before travelling to the worksite, the Electrician tasked with scanning for UG services picked up the scanning equipment from the warehouse which consisted of a cable scanner and a metal detector. The Electrician tested the batteries of both devices. He ran the scanner over a live cable to test the device and recorded a positive reading. The Electrician ran the metal detector over a bolt and recorded a positive reading. The Electrician arrived at the work site and discussed the area to be scanned with the Supervisor. The Supervisor pointed out the area to be excavated including where the tank is to be positioned. The Electrician had a look for evidence of possible services in the area and found nothing. No service drawings are available for the area. The area was first scanned with the cable locator, looking for evidence of live electrical wiring. Next the Electrician used the metal detector and conducted two sweeps over the whole work area running north south and east west. No positive readings were recorded. The Electrician advised the Area Operator that the work area had been scanned for services and that no services had been identified. The Electrician signed the JSA verifying that the area had been scanned. The Permit Holder and the Area Operator signed the permit to work as did the Excavator Operator. The Area Operator and the Electrician left the work site. At 1340 the work crew held a toolbox talk reviewing permit pack documents including the Permit to work, JSA, SWP Checklist for Excavation and ground disturbance, RPS Energy UXO Survey Report and septic tank drawings. The process for excavation was discussed as well as the potential hazards, risks and risk control measures as documented in the JSA. The SWP checklist was completed.The crew then prepared for excavation. The Excavator Operator started to excavate the batter to a depth of approximately 2.7m. Further excavation continued at a depth of approximately 2.7m deep x 1.2m wide. Moving to the next required excavation, the operator removed soil to a depth of approx. 400mm. The spotter was standing diagonally in front of the backhoe approximately 4 - 5m away. On discarding the spoil in the spoil pile, the operator noticed what he thought to be a UXO near to, or at the bottom of the excavator bucket and exposed on discarding the spoil.Risk Assessment ePTW pack including: · Permit to work· JSA, JSA signed onto by all members of the work crew · SWP Checklist for Excavation and ground disturbance· RPS Energy UXO Survey Report · Septic tank drawings. The process for excavation was discussed as well as the potential hazards, risks and risk control measures as documented in the JSA. The JSA identified the possibility of finding underground services and JSA controls included use of: o Metal detectors and electronic scanners identifying U/G services before working o Follow underground service drawingsThe JSA also described the possibility of finding a UXO with the pre-mentioned RPS survey used as verification that a survey had been conducted. Contingency controls included:o Stop work. Stay away on the chance find minimum 30 to 100mo Call Supervisor / JOC 3042888o Barricade the work area and keep everyone away from the chance findo Only PNG DF EOD will be allowed to enter the chance find area and handle the potential UXO chance findo Use SWP Excavation and Ground Disturbance Checklist as guide before, during and after the work. The SWP checklist was completed.o All workers to be oriented on the Unexploded Ordnance Protocol GuidanceWGPSN Working with or near to Underground Services Procedure was in place and complied with. The EMPNG UXO Protocol and OIMS 6-4 WMS SWP Excavation and Ground Disturbance were adhered to the best knowledge of those involved in work planning.Post Incident ActionThe crew members immediately stopped work and initiated the chance find UXO protocol. The operator stopped work and notified the spotter of the find. The operator moved the backhoe away and set up an exclusion zone with barricading while the spotter reported the UXO find to his supervisor on his mobile phone however could not contact him. The Foreman arrived at approximately 1610. He was informed of the find and radioed through to the supervisor. All required personnel were then notified.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #28769The two firewater pumps are test ran each Saturday. On 30th January during testing the Operations team experienced both pumps starting almost together rather than the 10 second delay between the start of the electrical pump followed by the diesel pumps. They identified that a pressure switch was defective and created a Work Order. This was a repeat of an identified defect in November which was checked but no defect was found at that time. During a telephone interview, it was established that the operator confirmed that the two pressure switches and the pressure transmitter had been closed as part of fault finding/resetting activities, and they could not confirm that the valves were opened following this activity. It can be seen from the DCS trends that the transmitter was isolated at this time. There is no operational reason for anyone else to isolate these instruments. The closed instrument valves were discovered at the test one week later. The isolating of the switches means the firewater pumps would not activate automatically when a fire monitor was brought into use. There would likely be a delay of approximately two minutes whilst the operations team recognise the non-starting of the pump and then activated the pump from the control room. The firewater system is primarily used for adjacent plant cooling rather than fire fighting.-------------------------------------------------------------Routine Firewater pump Testing As per the schedule, we were tasked the job of carrying out routine testing of the firewater pumps. Normally, when opening the spill back valve, the ring main pressure will drop and will cause the electric pump to start up automatically. In this case, this never happened. The pressure continued to drop and the Diesel firewater pump also did not kick in to life. I contacted the control room operator who informed me that their indication on the DCS from the ring main pressure hadn’t dropped and no low alarms came in, therefore led us to fault finding why this was happening. Along with another operator we discovered that the PSLL32007, PALL 32003 and PIT32006 was locally isolated via a needle valve manifold arrangement which are not locked open valves and are not captured on the P&amp;amp;ID, although V17 and V39 are locked open valves coming from main pipework.Furthermore, we reinstated the switches and transmitter which consequently started up the electric firewater pump as per the logic. It is known there has been an issue with the PSLL which has been causing both pumps to start at one time, which as WO has been raised for.

Visa requirements did not get checked during the travel booking process. Otherwise I would have applied for business visa, which is what the other Wood Group guys are travelling on.I am uncomfortable about travelling under these circumstance and would welcome your thoughts.The local WGPSN rep. Ahmed Yehia tells me that it is OK to travel on a tourist visa. The risk is I get deported - I don’t fancy getting locked up in an Egyptian prison cell waiting to be deported! Perhaps I’m being over cautious, but I’m worried that the advice below does not fit well with Wood Group Core Values.I’ve asked Group Travel if travelling on the wrong visa invalidates any of our travel insurance, emergency assistance etc., but have yet to receive a response.Of particular concern for future reference is that there also appears to be a disconnect between booking travel with Frosch and involving Group Travel for travel to high risk destinations (as Egypt is designated). Whilst we went through the proper process for booking the flights and air tickets as you would do for a low risk destination, Group Travel were not consulted. As a result I also ended up with an airport “meet and greet” being organised, which did not meet the normal recommended Wood Group process for arriving in Egypt. Also, I am booked into the same hotels as my Wood Group colleagues, but as Group Travel have not been involved, the hotels may not have been given the correct instructions regarding room booking (i.e. between 3rd and 5th floors to meet security/safety recommendations). My concern is what else has not been done according to the procedure for travelling to a high risk country.Neither are my vaccines up-to-date as it took a while to get advice on arranging them through the company. I’ve made an appointment myself at Boots this afternoon. Some coverage is better than none.Perhaps I am being overly cautious and I could have been more involved in the travel arrangements, but I’ve had other things to think about and was relying on proper process to work. Money at risk is £377 for the air fare.Best regards,Andrew GilmoreBusiness Development Manager – Offshore Business UnitWood Group MustangExport HouseCawsey WayWokingGU21 6QX</td>\n",

The crew held there morning safety meeting with all personnel that was going to be involved with the tie in including Saddle Butte Inspectors, Safety, and Operations. After the meeting Lockout Tagout was performed with the client and the crew. All parties agreed on the purposed plan for the tie in that was going to be made after cold cutting the 12” line that had been previously drained out by the client which utilized a pump truck. The Tie in that was going to be made was located behind a 12” ball valve that was locked out that morning. The valve was bled down after locked out and the crew began to cold cut the existing 12” line so it could be removed and the new section of prefabbed pipe cold be flown in with the crane and set for the weld to be made. Cold cutting started at approximately 8:30am and the pipe was set and ready to be welded at 2:30. When the pipe was flown in the crew installed an airbag located behind the valve. Prior to the crew taking lunch the Welder noticed a small amount of oil leaking out from under the airbag. The welder used a diaper to wipe up the oil and left it behind the airbag. Once they returned from lunch the welder made his tack and heard a boom. The diaper that was used to wipe up the oil had caught fire and popped the air bag that was in place. As the air bag popped a small amount of oil was noticed running out of the pipe. The crew immediately stopped work and Saddle Buttes inspector and Operations were notified. The situation was assessed by all parties and a plan was formed before any other welding took place.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #30401The requirement to disable the asset and prevent start-up before personnel enter the WTG is well known and well understood by our OCs in SCC. The main issue identified by this event is the requirement for training project specific intricacies of the prototype WTG that is controlled in a custom manner compared to the industry standard.We have had four OCs join since January, two of them in April. The LDT has been non-operational during the latter half of April and early May due to a long running fault. It has been identified that the new joiners, which were on duty 13 May 16, had not gained sufficient experience on the requirements for this specific LDT asset. Further training shall be implemented immediately and documentation augmented as soon as practicable.The OCs should apply a STOP command to LDT via the Windhelm SCADA software anytime personnel are within the WTG. The asset is programmed to apply other STOP commands itself based on a pre-determined specification; one of these is a noise curtailment STOP depending on the time of day, wind speed and wind direction. However, as the environmental conditions can vary meaning the noise curtailment STOP command can be released without warning. Furthermore, due to a legacy SCADA programming issue identified during handover, the noise curtailment STOP commands are not visible or recorded within Windhelm SCADA software.The OCs on duty on 13 May 16 state that the noise curtailment was active when the personnel entered the WTG. It is assumed, because Windhelm is unable to record noise events, that the noise curtailment STOP was automatically released whilst the personnel were within the WTG. The asset event register has been downloaded and attached to this report. The extract from the SCC OC events log is also attached. The SCC OC log shows two visits in to the WTG on 13 May 16 without any STOP command recorded in the Windhelm event record.The fact that the personnel were next to the breaker when it operated is not in itself dangerous and the breaker was not under load at the time. However, it is good practice to vacate the vicinity during HV breaker operations in case there is a catastrophic failure of the breaker during operation (this is a low probability, especially off load). Even if the personnel had been up in the nacelle, they would not have been in any severe danger; personnel can be in the nacelle during asset operation (machinery is guarded) but this is done under bespoke risk assessment situations.This specific WTG is left with the Local/Remote switch left in Remote, due to a specific prototype issue requiring near-continuous yaw system operation, during normal personnel access and only switched to Local (Manual) for tasks where machinery isolation is required as an additional safety precaution. In Local/Manual mode, there is no risk of unintentional start-up. As the personnel were only walking around the WTG, no Local/Manual mode was appropriate.The near-miss is raised because there has been a miss-interpretation of the state of the asset during work; even though the personnel could have been in the same location at the time of the incident if it were intended. The knowledge and documentation gap shall be addressed.</td>\n",

They removed the flat battery and placed it in module 131 battery room, they then informed the Acting Instrument Supervisor and an Instrument Technician that the battery required recharging.At Approximately 1700hrs on 19/05/16 two Instrument techs went to module 131 to put the battery on charge. When they entered the module they noted that there were two battery chargers on top of the Perspex Safety Cube. The battery was placed in the cube while charging as an added safety measure. The normal lifeboat battery charger was there but was marked up as not working. The tech’s decided to use the other charger which was 12/24v. They placed the battery in the safety cube and connected the positive and negative cable clamps ensuring that they were in the correct position on the battery. They checked the current reading on the display which was over 10 amps indicating that the battery was flat. On connecting the charger they assumed it was set to 12v and did not notice that the positive cable was fixed to the 24v terminal on the charger. They switched the charger on and left the battery to charge overnight.Historically, this task has been allocated to the Instrument techs and has been conducted without a permit as it was considered a minor routine task. On 20/05/16 at approximately 0745hrsTwo Instrument Techs were walking past module 131 lower when they noticed an unusual smell. On investigation they discovered that the 12v battery that was on charge was emitting fumes. They isolated the battery and reported to the HSE Advisor. The HSE Advisor, OIM, REP and OSTL immediately went to the scene to assess the situation.</td>\n",

I would like to write up a safety issue with the driver though. As we were leaving the airport his mobile had an alert, he picked up his phone and so I spoke out ensuring there was no silent consent. He did put The phone down then.If that was the only incident I wouldn't have been too concerned. However, when driving too close on the M23 I requested he back off. He argued and stated he was not too close. We were roughly a cars length behind the vehicle in front, traveling at 70 mph. I requested again that he back off and I was told I should leave him do his job. I further requested and in response he rapidly made his way to the slow lane where he proceeded to drive slowly for the remainder of the journey. Again however at one point so close to a highway maintenance tuck I felt the need to speak out.I feel the driver was being belligerent in refusing to over take and driving at 55 mph for the remainder of the journey but that's ok. I would rather that then be in a life threatening situation, for not just myself but him and others around us.Can you please feed this back the transport company and request this is followed up.Hardly a nice experience after a 13 hour flight.Safe home.

No workers were on the landing as they were following hoisting protocols and remained in the tunnel entrance, fully protected from the effects of falling debris. The material comes prepackaged from the manufacturer and typically has the cement fines on the bottom as a stable platform with the aggregate bags on the top. In the instance of this load the loading was reversed from the manufacturer with the aggregate on the bottom and the cement fines on the top.

Just as the half height was about to touch down the crew of the NOA Protector reported something coming off the half height and falling onto the deck. The vessels deck crew were watching this from the protected zone at the bow end of the ship. It is estimated that the bridal guard only fell three to four feet, weighing approx.1.5Kg which shows as slight(Green) on the drops calculator.When the half height was safely positioned and disconnected from the crane hook the vessels deck crew found that one of the lifting bridal guards had parted from it.The platform deck crew asked for the half height and the bridal guard to be returned to the platform for inspection.The on shore Inspection TA who is currently on board the platform was asked to look at the parted bridal guard.One of the ends has signs of being repaired in the past. Weld imperfections (porosity) are obvious on this side (Picture 1 attached) with presence of sizeable cavities where no welding material can be found.On the other side, the plate was just welded on a small section(3-4mm) across the whole length with the rest of the area showing evidence of being exposed to environment as it shows signs of corrosion (Picture 2 attached)</td>\n",

Depending on the daily work scope, the worker either mobilises to the jack up barge with marine contractors via vessel, or enters the KGP front gate for administrative work in the KLE west maintenance office.3. The worker had previously transported the iPad to the marine jack up barge via the water transport vessel from the Qube facility at the Dampier Port Authority.4. On the morning of the event, the worker entered KGP via the front security gates to attend morning meetings. The breach of site rules occurred when the IP mistakenly removed the iPad from the marine jack up barge, and into the operational area to attend end of shift debrief discussions.5. Discussion with WEL KLE Operations notes that non-IS administrative office equipment can be used on the marine based jack-up barge without permit, however a permit is required if this equipment is moved onto the LNG/LPG jetty or land.6.

Donnie parked the truck and trailer approximately 65’ away from the overhead lines with plenty of clearance for unloading the bucket safely. Operator Chuck Shreve tracked a 490 Komatsu excavator approximately 40’ to the trailer to unload the bucket and then unloaded the bucket with the machine positioned within 10’ of the overhead lines. The bucket was unloaded from the 490 excavator and as Chuck moved bucket he contacted the overhead fiber optic line. Employee John Jones was nearby and yelled at Chuck to stop. Chuck stopped turned the excavator in the opposite direction and set the bucket on the ground. No one was injured during the event. Chuck immediately notified project manager Ben Fowler and his immediate supervisor Steve Beight. Operator was sent for a drug test the following morning as there were no facilities open to administer at the time of the incident. Rapid results came back negative. Traffic was then diverted around the low lying fiber line until AT&amp;amp;T could get on site to raise the line back to its original condition. Mr. Shreve has over 2,000 documented hours of operating heavy equipment and is a qualified operator. Ultimately he demonstrated poor judgement positioning the excavator so close to the overhead lines, when there was ample room to maintain a safe distance.

They state that they did check it for power and it was dead, they also state they checked the lock out tag for the relevant breaker was in place. Later in the shift a PSNK Supervisor noticed a lightilluminated on the emergency shower. Initial findings are that the panel was live although some circuits were isolated andsome were in a live state. An ICC was in place for these isolated circuits. The circuit the team worked on was in the off position but not locked off as per the site LOTO procedure and wasn't included on the ICC attached to the PTW. There is also credible evidence that the Technician terminated the cable into thewrong terminalwhich was in a live state.The job was stopped and immediate action was taken to make the panel safe.

Whilst on the pipe deck there was evidence on the temporary exhaust stack of a collision as the paint had been scratchedThe crane walkway and boom were inspected by the crane operator and he was satisfied that the minor damage only affected the boom walkway &amp;amp; not the main boom structureThe STL instructed the crane operator and deck crew to maneuver the crane near the temporary exhaust stack. This confirmed thatthe damage on the boom matches up with impact-scratch marks on the exhaust stackNo other damage was observed to platform structures other than the exhaust stack. The platform derrick was out of rangeFurther investigations are now taking place to determine 'when' the damage occurred, who was on shift, and why the damage wasn't reportedReported as a 'subcontractor' event because the crane operator is a Sparrows employee but the deck crew are all WG employedSparrows Crane Operator has admitted to causing the damage and not reporting it.

Briefed by their Supervisoron the planned works , their shift started at 0730hrs . This was a continuation of on going dismantling works of thehanging scaffoldThe incident involved 2 of the scaffolder's who were tasked withlowering dismantled scaffold tubes to the dockside ( refer to photo - a distance of approx. 25 m) . Tony Ritson ( advanced ) scaffolder was at ground level receiving the lowered tubes and Paul Graham (basic ) was working from the scaffold platform overhead ,using a hand line to lower the tubes- both very experienced scaffolder's . The area immediately below where the scaffold tubes were being lowered was cordoned off ( barrier tape ) / creating a safe zone to land the tubes and TR was acting a sentryto prevent any3rd party access. The Topman lowering the tube had full visibility of the dockside with the second operator located outside the safe zone until the tube hade reached the dockside - this process had been repeated on numerous occasions that shift . The sentry at ground level did not see or hear the alleged incident as he was wearing hearing protection and had his back turned to the landing area - their was significant background noise in this area from 2 alpha fans. . On interview the Topman lowering the scaffold tube confirmed he had lost control of the hand line during the final descent of the tube to the dockside ,a distance estimated to be up to 10m - the line had been looped over the top handrail to act as break but is dependent on the operative controllingthe line . The scaffold tube being lowered consisted of a 21' with 4 scaffold fittings and a small trapeze bar fitted to the bottom of the tube ( approx. weight of34 kgs ).The way tube had been secured to the hand line it would have remained in a vertical position pointing to the Docksideas it was lowered. The sentry / scaffolder at the quayside turned to find the tube hadlanded and was resting against the mooring line in a vertical position with the hand line still attached - he removed the line / took the tube to the stillage and the two opsrepeated thistask until the end of their shift without incident .Subsequently informed by Babcock's , approx. 12 hrs afterthe 'event' ,anelectrical 100A cablehad beendamaged in the area where the scaffold tubes were being lowered by the WGIS scaffold team. From the description given by the Client the electrical linewas energized at the time of the alleged strike ,powering the lighting at the aft end of the ship - the photos attached show the damage to the cable and also scorch marks on the end of a scaffold tube . If energized when struck it had tripped back to the distribution board making it safe . Thetwo scaffolderer's were re interviewed on the 'line strilke' and they both stated that they were not aware that a cable had been damaged during their work activity - the photos taken of the damaged cableand a scorched scaffold tube providing compelling evidence that an event did take place . The 2 scaffolders were suspended pending the investigation and have stuck to the description of events .Further investigation on site confirmed that the area below where the scaffold materials were being lowered did have a number of' live' service cables / lines passing across the quayside - see attached photos . The standard of cable management in these areas was poor and in retrospect the works should not have started until this was addressedie either the cables tidied or covered with suitable protection.The RAMS used by the Scaffold team did not cover the use of hand lines and lowering of scaffold tubes onto the Quayside and in particular areas where high voltage cables passed through the work area . The Scaffold team at the task did identify via the POWSA the need to use handlines to lower scaffold materials to the quayside / use of barrier controls and rotating ops lowering the scaffold components but like the mainRAMS did not identify the hazards associated with service electrical lines passing through the work area and a potential line strike if a scaffold components was dropped from height .A number of actions have been identified at this stage of the investigation / investigation is still open as we are awaiting further information from Babcock's</td>\n",

The source of the odour was found to be associated with the fluids contained within Crude Oil Storage Tank B (COST B) which was undergoing routine conditioning in preparation for export, due before the end of this year.On receipt of the odour alert from The Dewings, the COST B conditioning operation (heating and recirculating) was ceased. The Operations Manager was informed via telecommunication and followed up by e-mail which is attached for reference. The weather conditions at the time of the complaint were dry and slightly cloudy with a WSW wind at 2.6 knots.An offsite olfactory assessment was carried out around Nigg village and no further odour was detected.Regular odour monitoring was carried out following the cessation of the COST B conditioning operation which determined that it took ~2 hours for the odour to dissipate. The source of the odour was found to be the COST B tank roof vents which are designed to allow the roof to float on the surface of the oil as it is imported and exported while ensuring that no undue pressure is exerted on the tank structure</td>\n",

The IE was following a Morooka buggy in a rubber tire backhoe. The two pieces of equipment came to a section of the right of way were there was about a 8 percent grade. At the bottom of the grade was a bell hole where a pipeline tie in had been made the day before. The morooka buggy reached the top of the hill and started to back up so it could turn around. The IE wanted to give the morooka more space so he tried put the backhoe in reverse. When he started to back up he realized that the backhoe was in neutral and engaged the brake. The brake caused the backhoe to start to tip backward, so he let off the brake and continued to drift backwards. At this point the backhoe started to slid into the bell hole. When the rear tire hit the transition from the bell hole to the bottom of the ditch it caused the tire to loose air pressure causing the back hoe to tip on its side. The forks on the backhoe came in contact with the new construction 16” pipeline. The 16” line is currently being installed and no hydrocarbons are present. No injuries were recorded. The only damage to the backhoe was a deflated tire and scratches to the 16” pipeline, which was removed and replaced the same day.</td>\n",

At 8pm the task was completed and the client operations had began topping up the vaporizer unit with water. As the 28” flange was located at the bottom of the vaporizer unit, as soon as the water level reached the 28” flange, it was noticed by client operations that there was drip leak noticed at the 28” flange. Immediately WG mechanical technicians tightened the flange bolts and the leak was rectified.

Later the foreman went outside the shop where there was piping placed about 2' above the ground on pipe support cones. The employee caught his toe as he was stepping over one of the pipes. This caused him to fall and he struck his nose/head on another piece of piping. The IP was not aware of the injury to his nose until another employee pointed the bleeding out to him.The IP was likely suffering from symptoms of a concussion later diagnosed. He went to therestroom and cleaned up theinjury. He continued to work on hydrotest piping.Coworkers noticing odd behavior from the IP at this time(likely form a concussion).The IP attempted to use a wrench to tightena latch on a leaking pipe door latch. The IP tried to tighten the latch with a wrench not realizing a gasket wasmissing. He over tightened the bolt and it broke off.When the boltbroke,the IP dislocated his ringer finger on his left hand.A coworker was going to give the IP a ride home at this point. He wanted to take him to the hospital but the IP refused.The IP was dropped off at home. A few hours later the IP returned to the shop where the Shop manager told him he needed to be seen at a medical clinic. The ER stitched his nose, diagnosed him with a concussion, reset his finger, and gave him pain medication. The IP was then taken to our occupational med doctor for evaluation and then released. The IP returned home.Later we received word that the IP was unable to be woken up and emergency services were contacted. Upon an ambulance ride to another ER, the IP requireda lifeflight transferal andadmittanceto an another ICU due to a adversereaction with medication given at the initial ER.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #3638802 FEB 2018 A Hexagon employee was observed on top of M50 GT-b roll out table/ skid not wearing fall protection. The potential risk was for the employee to fall to M50 deck which is 1.4 meters and/ or to the main deck which is 6.6 meters from the top of the table/ skid. The employee was on the top of the table/ skid for a short period of time; his Supervisor did not want to shout from the main deck to avoid distracting him. After theemployee was safely back on the on deck the Supervisor shouted asking him where his harness was and why he was not hooked on. The supervisor signalled him to stop the job and approached him to explain the hazards and concerns. The job was stopped and a Time Out for Safety was called with all 4 team members to highlight the seriousness of this high potential incident and to remind them about the risk of being removed from the facility as per a previous incident that occurred with a subcontractor. A follow up Safety stand down was called and the incident was discussed with the OIM, Maintenance Supervisors, Safety Officer and the team members.Based on the employee’s statement, he decided to climb up to remove the shackle as part of housekeeping. The employee chose not to wear his fall protection as it would have taken longer to reach up to the slings and connect his fall arrestor than it would to climb up and remove the shackle without protection. The initial investigation revealed that a safety harness was on site and 2x slings secured to the structure for connecting the fall arrestor. This indicated the need for increasing awareness and need for using fall protection.03-FEB-2018Detailed investigation is ongoing.08-FEB-2018It has been agreed by the FPSO OIM, client HSE manager and in-country Hexagon management the following:The Hexagon employee will travel back onshore to conduct KTEG Golden Rules refresher training, this will be augmented by Woods LSR information. This will include a practical element assessment to identify the suitable lanyard and fall prevention equipment in various working at height scenarios; on a ladder, scaffolding, similar situation to where the incident occurred.Once the training has been completed, employee will be required to prepare a working at height training course (presentation attached)based on the training that he has gone through onshore. The employee will travel back offshore to complete his rotation, he will be required to present his training package to the on board FPSO personnel.The employee will travel back offshore 13 FEB 2018. Before he travels offshore the Wood Safety Cocoon package will be re-rolled out to the employee.12 FEB 2018The Just and Fair Culture - Decision tree has been reviewed and followed.It has been agreed that the employee's action was a'Personnel Opportunistic Violation' - the employee varied from the Wood and KT procedure to make it easier for themselves i.e. taking less time to remove the shackle without wearing the required and detailed fall protection equipment.Formal disciplinary action has been considered and will be discussed with the employee by the in-country Hexagon Operations manager prior to the employee returning offshore 13-FEB-2018.During the investigation is was identified that the onsite supervisor (Lead Mechanic) did instruct the employee to remove the lifting and hoisting equipment as per the agreed plan, which included wearing the detailed working at height fall arrest equipment. However at the time of the incident the onsite supervisor did not witness the employee violating the working at height procedure. It was in fact the passing maintenance supervisor who witnesses the employee working at height without the required fall protection. Thus leading to the decision that the lead mechanic does not require formal disciplinary action. The lead mechanic was involved in the time out for safety and the investigation process. 13-FEB-2018Additional information received from the FPSO Maintenance Supervisor:The roll out table was still in progress of being constructed and was not yet a free open working area.The use of harness’s was requested by the maintenance supervisor and hook in points installed (as they were) to be used. In additional to support this, scaffolders were asked to install a hard scaffold barrier inboard on the M50 process deck area, preventing any personnel not involved with the construction of the roll out table passing into this area by accident. The hard barrier was and still is fitted between the handrail and M50 GTB booster pump skid.The Hexagon employee involved with the incident was inside his own hard barrier controlled area as a work party team member. He was working under a permit for the task of constructing the roll out table and he had been involved in all TBT’s, permit conversations, planning and instruction for this task to be completed safely. 19-FEB-2018Confirmation email and attendance sheets were sent from FPSO Safety Officer for the 4 safety meetings the employee presented their presentation at.Feedback given from the offshore management team was that the employee did a great job presenting and the material he had put together was very detailed and of high quality.HIP - 14th FebruaryProduction - 17th FebruaryMarine - 18th FebruaryMaintenance - 18th February27-FEB-2018IRP was held with Africa HSE Manager, Hexagon Country Manager, Hexagon KTEG Operations manager and Hexagon HSE Advisor.The presentation was reviewed and comments made.

Bore Contractor was provided with 12” bore plans illustrating 5’ of horizontal separation between center pipe of 8” damaged pre-existing line and center pipe of Client's 12” future line. Client representative requested that Bore Contractor be prepared to have two crews work a day and night shift until the bore has been completed. Bore Contractor agreed and began coordinating their plan. The urgency resulted from nearby burrowing owls, and additional lines that needed to be bored on the same ROW with approaching deadlines. Bore Contractor started drilling pilot hole using 6” tri-hawk. Taking depths at every 20 feet. Client inspector walked with Bore Foreman to verify an accurate path on the line. At approximately 10:30pm Wood Safety, recognized an issue. Drilling operator was having a hard time reaming due to possible underground rock formation. Wood Safety began walking East about 100 feet towards existing above ground pig trap. There was noise and vibration on the above ground pig trap piping. Wood and Bore Contractor shut the rig down and used stop work authority.Proper notifications were made regarding the concerns of the noise and vibration of the above ground pig trap during the reaming operations. Client representative listened to the pipe and requested that Bore Contractor spin the reamer to hear if the drill was hitting the pipe. Client representative then stated that it appears the reamer is hitting rock and that’s the source of the sound (i.e. the drill vibrating the rock which is in turn vibrating the pipe). Client representative informs Bore Contractor and Wood that it is okay to continue reaming. Reamer passes through the underground rock formation (actually pipe). The noise and vibration stop after approx. 15 min of continuous vibration while pulling approximately 30 feet of reamer. Bore Labor, noticed fluid coming into potholes. Wood Safety swept the pothole with a 4-gas monitor and high LELs were present. Work is stopped for the second time to assess the situation.04/10/18:At approximately 1:30 am, it was approved for a vac truck to extract the unknown product from the potholes. After they sucked out the potholes, it appeared that the product wasn’t entering potholes anymore. Client Representative observed the pot holes. After several minutes Client Representative notified Bore Contractor that it was okay to continue reaming. Reaming was completed at 8:30 am.Bore Contractor was ready to pull the pipe. Pipe wasn’t pulled because product began filling the potholes again, and yet again it was causing LEL levels to rise upon sweeping the potholes with a 4-gas meter; at this time all bore operations were ceased until further investigation was completed.Please request a copy of Formal Report for full details</td>\n",

The Fin Fan deck is accessed by a stairs at the east end of the process pipe rack. Small material was carried by hand, other materials i.e. scaffolding, packs of insulation etc were lifted by the 360 Telehandler to the process pipe rack. The crew were using drop mats and sheets of barrier mat to prevent material or tools falling through the decking (open mesh grating). Scaffold boards were used as a makeshift bench when cutting the insulation. Both Shell and WGIS provide drop mats, however Shell provide the drop boxes on the fin fan deck. They’re permanently located there and are for communal use. The supervisor had visited the area the morning before, however had not been to the work location the morning of the near miss. The work was carried out under permit and the toolbox talk was carried out by the Permit Holder at the work location. The work crew had used the spirit level earlier in the morning as a straight edge when cutting the flexible cladding and had placed the spirit level down close to where they are working, but are unsure if it was left standing up against the pipe or flat on the ground. The spirit level fell from the deck to the exclusion zone below where a nearby Ops Tech heard it hit the ground. It is suspected that the spirit level fell through the decking however the work crew are unsure of exactly what happened. Management of tools was covered in the risk assessment on the permit. However tethering of the spirit level is not practical.The spirit level weighed 0.8kg and fell from 13.5m from the deck; in accordance to the Drops Calculator it could have caused a fatality. However taking into account the average height of an operative as 1.8m then the actual distance dropped were it to hit personnel who had entered the exclusion zone reduces to 11.7m which in accordance with the drops calculator it would have been classified as having major consequences and reduce the injury potential to an LTI.</td>\n",

The IPwas working at the drive end of the pump whilstMechFitterwas working to the non-drive end. At this timethe Seal Engineerwas overlooking the work being carried out by the IP. At this timethe IPwas wearing Skytec Disposable Nitrile Gloves at the time having applied “O” seal grease to the coupling.During the taskthe IPwas having difficulty sliding the seal coupling into position onto the drive shaft due to a tight fit and was advised byhe Mech Fitterto manage it into position by rolling it. The IP reported that it was 8” from reaching the face plate, when a few seconds later the Seal coupling moved freely without notice and causedthe IPto trap the fingers of his left hand between the Seal and the seal face plate.This caused some pain and resulted in an almost immediate bruise and swelling appearing on his left ring finger. He stopped for a few moments and then resumed to the pump shaft and completed the tightening up of the seals.

There was a raised section of scaffold pans approximately 4 feet by 8 feet. Due to the design of the scaffold the Pans were placed in the opposite direction to close any gaps, this action meant the pans were raised. The IP stood on the edge of one of the raised Pans and went over his right ankle, twisting the outside of his ankle downwards.

This incident occurred while the employees were working to expose the line to perform work on the midline fitting, or Swage as it’s known. (A Swage, is Flex Steel’s way of ensuring a reliable connection point and line pipe integrity). The topsoil was removed via motor-grader, and 2 feet of subsoil was removed with a track-hoe. This allowed for the Hydrovac to pothole 3 feet to expose the fitting. The midline fitting was uncovered using Hydrovac. The team exposed the center of the midline fitting with a pothole straight down. Next the crew began using the excavator to excavate next to the line (parallel), on the South side of the line. The crew was excavating next to the line to create a bellhole for safe entry around the midline fitting. The crew needed to access the Swage to perform leak testing/pressure mapping, as well as take measurements 2’ from the center of the Swage in both directions. As the Operator was digging approximately 2’ south of the fitting toward the track-hoe in the direction the line was traveling, the bucket contacted the pipe 4’ from the potholed midline fitting. The contact continued for another 3’ and a hole was incurred in the piping 7’ from the Swage fitting. The Operator stopped and told onsite Supervisor there was suspicion that the line was contacted. The Supervisor instructed the Operator to slope sides back for safe entry. Belled hole was inspected and Crew with shovels entered to expose the line and damage to line was unearthed. The crew found that the pipe dog legged (deviated from the center of ditch due to the curl of FlexSteel spool) to the South, just East of the swaged midline fitting. Work was stopped and notifications to the proper individuals occurred. It is important to note that no injuries or product loss occurred as the line is newly constructed, and still under Wood’s possession, yet to be put in service, and is part of a produced water gathering system still under construction by Wood. This area of piping had been installed, backfilled, with the right-of-way reclaimed 6 weeks prior, and was being exposed at the request of the Client and FlexSteel material vendor for manufacturer defect detection.</td>\n",

They had lifted it into position on a pump work bench. It was lifted in two sections the coupling end first which was then secured to the bench using a ratchet strap. The second section, the Casing/ Flange end was then lifted into position and whilst supported by the overhead crane it was bolted to the coupling end by the fitters. (The Pump was now top heavy) This end was also secured to the bench using a ratchet strap. Two straps now secured the whole pump. On Thursday 14th the pump was painted and left in this position until Monday 18th June 2018, whenfitter 1returned to work.Fitter 1then recognised that he had not painted beneath the two ratchet straps securing the pump to the bench. He decided to release the ratchet mechanism to relax the strap to the coupling end with the intention of sliding it to one side whilst he finished the paint application.AsFitter 1operated the ratchet mechanism the restraining strap fully released causing the unbalanced pump weighing 134kg to tip and fall from the bench (1 metre) to the concrete floor causing subsequent damage to the suction flange.

Operator was backfilling the trench containing this EDB. EDB is comprised of 5” Ø horizontally laid fiberglassconduit extending through a 90° bend and then vertically into 5” Ø rigid PVCpipe. This vertical section is the riser. Two (2) Risers extended about 9’-9” out of the ground and were highly visible “inthe open”. Operator was back-fillingthe trench and had the excavator positioned such that boom was over the top ofthe risers. Motion of the boom over thetop of the risers was a vertical motion. A sketch has been uploaded in the attachments. During the back-filling process, the boom made vertical contact with the top of 2risers. The risers sheared near groundlevel where the fiberglass section joined the vertical rigid PVC section. WHY IT HAPPENED: This incident is the result of less than ideal positioning of the excavator boom in relation to the electrical duct bank risers/\"stub-ups\".

Due to the sandy conditions on the ROW in that area, pieces of heavy equipment were used to tow the needed vehicles throughout the day. When the crew needed to leave the ROW to access another area, rather than removing the sling used for towing, the driver chose instead to wrap the sling over the top of the truck’s brush guard, and proceeded to merge onto CR34.

Upgrade the JSA for backload &amp;amp; offload Mooring Supply Vessels and check all other lifting operations JSA’s and control related to potential defect on all loads to be lifted and add critical lift checklist to capture some controls even though it’s not a critical lift2. Look for door securing mechanism (not padlock) to properly secure the containers’ doorsReinforce inspection/checking of loads for materials to be lifted ashore (Mooring Supply Vessel crew)Refresh all teams involved in lifting and rigging operations on their responsibilities in always ensuring that all loads are adequately checked/inspected prior to be lifted.</td>\n",

This statement had not been recorded on the IP's witness statement taken at the time of the accident and had been discussed during the investigation process.Review of Work Scope:Erection, Modification and dismantle of an Independent scaffold tower.Preceding Events Potentially associated with the Incident:Congested work area within the plant boiler room had been an issue with scaffold erection and space for maneuverability.Investigation, Supporting Documents:Interviews , Witness Statements, IP Statement, Risk Assessment, Method Statement, Photographs.Root Cause Tool Used: 5 Why'sAdditional Cause Information:The work place location had not been properly assessed for hazards. Although hazard identification of process safety had been recorded within the task operational risk assessment RA7024-01 if a suitable point of work risk assessment had been carried out then the hazard of hot pipesshould have been identified as per the warning notices posted at the job location of the hot water sample points. The notices erected by the client could have been better with better identification signage posted in colour.Hot pipelines should be protected with a general safety factor of grade to 2 metres protected.Other relevant factors:The IP in question had been noted to be non -compliant to PPE compliance during a number of leadership visits. On the day of the HSE investigation a workplace walk round took place to the boiler house, Boiler 3 where the IP had again at this point observed without the correct PPE being adhered to. Just and Fair culture required / Coaching of PPE required.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #39695At approx. 13:30 hours on Friday the 31st of August it was reported by Melbourne Water that a Scaffolder had not called in or out through the control room for the scaffolding work he had performed that day in the Power Station.The Scaffolder was required to build a scaffold in order to perform work on the heat exchanger of engine 8 (Work Order no. 3687082). Due to operational requirements to maintain a maximum number of engines running at all times, Melbourne Water do not shut an engine down to perform scaffold work. Scaffolding is only performed on an opportune basis when an engine is shut down for servicing or if it has broken down, unless urgent.The Scaffolder was first tasked with this job on the 14th of August and started the scaffold on this day, but it was left incomplete as the engine was required in service again before completion. On the 14th the Scaffolder completed a Q4 TRA (RA041074) without submitting the Q4 request for permit as a permit is not required to complete scaffolding unless working under an isolation. He did not work under an isolation and worked solo. His belief is that he can work building a scaffold around an engine if the engine is shut down and it does not necessarily have to be isolated. On this day the Scaffolder did call in to the Control Room to advise he had started the job and again called in to advise job complete. See copy of Control Room log for 14th August 2018.Before the change to Melbourne Waters permit process, now called Control of Work, the Scaffolder would apply for a permit to perform the same task. The day before the 31st, the Scaffolder was asked to work again on the engine 8 scaffold as a 1500 hour service was planned and the engine would be shut down (Work Order no. WO3687409). The Scaffolders team leader had advised him other work groups would be working on engine 8. Work Order 3687082 for the heat exchanger scaffold does not appear on the control room log sheet as work for the 31st.A separate pre-start meeting is held every day by the personnel who normally work in the power station. The Scaffolder did not attend this meeting, but his Team Leader did.On the 31st the Scaffolder was to work with another person. The Scaffolder explained the task to the other person in the maintenance building and they proceeded to the scaffold yard to get required equipment. The Scaffolder checked with the mechanical crew member at approx. 08:00 if they were working on engine 8 and it was confirmed they were. At approx. 0900 before starting work the Scaffolder got the 2nd person to check and sign onto the Q4 TRA he had completed on the 14th. They then entered the power station and started work on the scaffold around engine 8. The Scaffolder stated he did not sign onto the permit for the 1500 hr service as it did not include his scaffold work scope.The Scaffolder stated during his interview that he did not call in to the Control Room as the other work group were working under a permit on engine 8 and he knew they had to be recorded as part of their permit. He relied upon this. The mechanical and electrical personnel were aware of each other and the two scaffolders who were working on engine 8. The mechanical and electrical personnel did not ask the scaffolders to sign on their permit under the isolation.The mechanical and electrical work scopes performing the 1500hr service had both signed onto the permit taken out by the Electrician.At approx. 11:00hrs the Scaffolders were advised that engine 8 was going to be restarted after lunch. So they worked till approx. 11:30 before lunch time and left the power station. They did not call the control room, again relying on the work ceasing to be communicated by the other work group under permit.Investigators observations post incident:· The Scaffolder had had a previous experience when he had called to sign out of a work area with the control room. In that instance the control room had already signed the job off because they had only one line to record all the works on for the one Work Order number. Another person had already called in. This led to his belief that if someone else had already called in, he would not need to.· During investigation of the incident at 15:25, the control room log for the 31st of August did only have one line allocated to the Work Order number for the 1500hr service. The name recorded was incorrect, not corrected to the person holding the permit and did not show that the workers allocated had already called in and signed off. This was corrected.· From interviews and discussions, there does appear to be a level of confusion associated with the management of SIMOPs/area monitoring for non-permitted work post the Control of Work introduction from MW staff and Wood personnel. There is evidence of multiple occasions where personnel have forgotten to call in, call out and failures to follow up when personnel appear to be still working on site after hours.</td>\n",

The crew rigged the launcher skid with two 12ft lifting slings located on each end of the skid wrapped around each corner of the skid in a basket hitch configuration, in this configuration each lifting sling is rated to 42,400lbs. All rigging was inspected prior to use. The lift was executed by using two track hoes located on each end of the launcher, each track hoe has a maximum lifting capacity of 42600lbs. The equipment operator’s successfully picked up and lowered the launcher from the trailer to the ground. The operators then had to move the launcher approximately 45 ft. to the north, the operators lifted the skid with the same slings in the same configuration approximately 18in off the ground and began tracking it when the center of gravity shifted do to the vibrations from the tracks, causing moderate damage to the valve gear box and handle.

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #39889Wood was engaged to undertake modifications to an existing foam pipeline as part of the Caltex Gladstone Terminal Fire Upgrade Project. The job was a planned outage of the Terminal fire protection system and involved installing a drain valve onto an existing flanged pipe spool (5m long x 150mm ID) that held foam-water solution. The pipe spool was removed with old gaskets still attached to the flange face at both ends and placed near-by on pipe stands in a designated hot work for modification. The flushing, draining and unbolting of the foam pipe spool was conducted by a local maintenance contractor (KNL Services) under Caltex supervision and on the separate work permit. It was not clear in the Caltex site asbestos register that the existing gaskets used for the spool were 100% asbestos, but precautions were taken when unbolting and removing the spool. They removed the gaskets from the flange faces using a scraping knife and placed them in a seal plastic bag as a precaution for disposal. A separate PTW was issued by Caltex to Wood to undertake hot work in the field. When the spool was being prepared for re-installation, the Wood fitter and welder (Wood subcontractor) proactively tried cleaning the flange faces with a wire brush wheel after attempts to use the scrapping knife to remove suspected gasket residue was unsuccessful. It was habit for the fitter to wear a disposable P2 mask and for the welder to wear a powered air purifying welding respirator (particulate pre-filter fitted) when undertaking buffing activities.The job was stopped, when the fitter suspected possible asbestos in the gasket material as it looked different to gaskets removed in the past. It is suspected some residue may have been left on the flange face and this was removed using a wire brush wheel. The fitter and welder were both asked to replace their clothing immediately. The area was also wetted down as a precaution. Clothing and gaskets were placed in double sealed bags. Licenced asbestos removalist contractor was engaged by Wood to take test samples and dispose of waste material.The gasket was later tested by a NATA accredited laboratory and confirmed to include white asbestos.</td>\n",

Wood Employee and Client conducted a walk-through of the job site before work began and visually inspected both cans by opening the lids to determine depth and direction of the Flexsteel line. Both parties came to the conclusion that the Flexsteel line ran North into the first can (South can) then quickly 90° into the North can. The Flexsteel appeared to have stopped in the North can because the valve was blinded off and did not continue North of the cans. Locates were called and cleared prior to the excavation activities but there were no above ground markings for the Flexsteel line. Wood EO also contacted the Wood Locator by phone to see if he knew of any lines on the north side. Wood locator was only aware of the Flexsteel line south of the cans. Wood EO excavated around the cans to a depth of about 4 feet and was going to have the hydrovac do the rest. Wood equipment operator decided to excavate more on the North side of the North can because he didn’t believe the Flexsteel line was there. When he began to dig he felt as if he had made contact with something, he immediately retracted and contacted the Hydrovac to expose the area. It was discovered that contact was made with an unmarked 8” Flexsteel line. The poly-coating on the line was peeled back but the steal was not punctured and there was no release of product. Further investigation determined that the Flexsteel did not 90° into the North can but instead “T” off into the North can and also continued running North. Wood equipment operator contacted the project superintendent to report the damage.Flexsteel rep reported to site and visually inspected and determined the integrity of the line was not compromised. But recommended that the appropriate repairs be made to the poly-coating.</td>\n",

The method chosen to reline the Sewer was pipe slip lining. This method involves sliding a series of FRP pipe sections within the current sewer to form a new pipeline. The pipe sections are connected through a male/female socket system. This system requires approximately 250kg of compression force to ensure the pipe connection is complete. The project team had developed a construction method that included a use of a hydraulic winch for pulling the pipe sections through the sewer. This method utilised the winch to complete the pipe connections by restraining the previous pipe section against the sewer wall with all personal to be located above the pipe section during winch operation. This construction method was reviewed and risk assessed by a WGPSN team.Approximately 2 months after the risk assessment pipe slip lining activities commenced on site. The proposed construction method was not effective in connecting the pipe sections as the pipe was moving during winch operation. The work crew attempted four different installation methods (i.e. wood block restraints, compression via come-along tool) to resolve the technical pipe connection problem with limited space. On Wednesday 27th January 2016, the work crew installed 2 Eye Bolts (rated capacity of 340kg) into the Man Hole/Sewer concrete wall and connected the far end of the slip piping with fibre slings to restrain the pipe system during winch operation. This allowed the new pipe section to be installed on to the pipe system by using the pulling force of the hydraulic winch. This construction method was proving to be the most successful over the next few working days.At approximately 13:30 on Wednesday 3rd February one of the installed Eye Bolts restraining the slip pipe system against the winch failed due to excessive tensile force. The released stored energy caused the head of the Eye Bolt (connected to the pipe system through fibre slings) to strike the IPs right arm in the elbow area. The IP was wearing the appropriate PPE which included a long sleeve shirt. The IP did not immediately realise the extent of damage as the clothing covered the wound. After exiting the man hole himself via a ladder the IP was assessed and treated immediately with first aid. The work site was made safe and the IP was taken to hospital for further treatment which included cleaning the wound, 5 stitches and infection prevention medication. The IP returned to work the next day (4/02/2016) with minor work restrictions to his daily duties. The IP returned to normal work duties after two working days.For sequence of event and more information/attachments see attached investigation report</td>\n",

The crew approached a manhole and needed a 6’ piece of pipe to complete the run into the structure. The pipe layer put his PPE on including gloves and a face shield which attached to the hard hat and started cutting the 12” round pipe approximately 2' from the bell end of the pipe. The pipe rested on flat ground making the pipe easy to manage and turn as he completed each section of the cut. With the cut almost complete the employee rolled the pipe away from him. This positioned the uncut portion of the pipe about knee high and inserted the saw into the pipe and started cutting in an upward direction. While cutting the pipe pinched the saw blade causing the saw to quickly stall and jump. The employee’s arms buckled allowing the running saw to strike him across the right side of his face, jaw, cheek and throat.The employee realized that he had been injured and walked over to his Pipe Forman who escorted him to the truck and started rendering first aid. The crew's loader operator noticed the employee holding his face and assisted by calling 911 and waiting at the entrance of the project to escort the ambulance back to the injured employee.

I like to keep one in my office as a matter of convenience. This Hole Punch has a knob to lock and unlock the punch press. I was trying to move this knob from the lock position to unlock position. Either I did not press the Punch press all the way down, or the knob was somehow jammed due to friction, not sure – but this knob did not move from lock to unlock position. Without much thought, I just gave it a strong push to move it from the lock position to unlock position. After a few seconds of high pressure push, this knob snapped from lock to unlock position. As it snapped, my thumb got into the line of fire – it hit one of the metal seats inside and cut open the top of my thumb and about 8mm of my nail. There was some blood. I became anxious seeing blood. I reached out to my neighbor Mr. Brad Bonnette. Brad assessed the situation, walked with me to the medical box, gave me band aid and some antiseptic wipes. I went to the rest room, washed the wound with soap and water, cleaned in up a little bit and put the band aid. Brad took the before and after pictures which I believe he submitted along with the MOSS report. I was out yesterday to run errands. The injured party went to Brad Bonnette'soffice, indicating he had cut his thumb while trying to open a stuck hole punch in his office. He appeared to sustain a cut underneath the nail of his left thumb, with moderate and controllable bleeding. The cut was approximately 1cm in length at the margin of where the thumbnail meets the thumb.</td>\n",

Investigation into the event discovered that stretch and flex had been accomplished, that the worker was team lifting the sheeting panel and that the weight of the panel is estimated to have been roughly 40 lbs. The sequence of events that led up to the injury are as follows; two workers were tasked to take the panel from a horizontal position into a vertical position at ground level. Once that was accomplished two additional workers in an aerial lift would take hold of the top section and assist with placement onto side of building. The individuals at ground level would install screws within reach and the workers in the MEWP would install all screws above that level.

IP was working night shift, incident occurred at 0400. IP arrived onshore at 0600, X-ray was taken to confirm fracture to the left index finger. IP is to send X-Ray to his orthopedic doctor in the US to confirm if surgery is required, if surgery is required IP will be flying out tonight. If no surgery is required IP will be placed on restricted duty offshore (OJT) for the remainder of his rotation (2 weeks). MEGPL HSE supervisory to conduct RCA , and to head offshore tomorrow AM. Request for Hexagon PM to be involved.The decision was made to fly theback home commercially upon recommendation from a surgeon at La Paz and consultation with the ISOS head office in Paris. HR in Houston are being informed and to assist with the follow up with medical treatment back in US.20-SEP-162 employees from Hexagon (Project Manager and HSE Advisor) travelled offshore to take part in the investigation with 2 employees from MEGPL and the on board HSE Supervisor.The initial investigation report was formulated (attached) and sent out to all relevant personnel.25-SEP-16MEGPL Offshore HSE Supervisor completed the final investigation; this was to be presented to the OIM for final review and comment before distribution.26-SEP-16Incident was re-classified from RWC to LWC; the initial number ofDays Lost inputted was 14 days as the IP had that many days left on his hitch. The IP is undergoing surgery on 28th September; after this we will have a better idea of the rehab days required before he can return to work.The Workmans' compensation claim number is - JY16J051781429-SEP-16Houston HR contacted the IP; IP confirmedhe had his surgery on 28th September and was doing well.He is due to return to the doctors on 6th October for a follow up and to have the stitches removed; but the review from the doctor was that everything went well.He was told by his doctor that he will have 4 weeks of recovery before he can return to work. After the 4 week period the doctor will assess the IP before to assess whether he is fit to return to his normal duties in EG. 28- OCT- 16 Houston HR contacted IP; IP indicated he had physical therapy for 2 more weeks and would not be able to travel/return to work until 09-NOV.7 -NOV-16HR contacted the IP and he stated that he is undergoing physical therapy 3 times a week. The doctor mentioned to him that the recovery process is taking longer than expected but that the IP will be able to return on his next rotation which is 27th December.21-NOV-2016The following are the client's action raised from the investigation. A corrective action will be added to the CAIRS case for monthly status updates of each action. (Updated 06 FEB 2017)1. 1. MEGPL HSE Department will review definitions and ensure there is clear consistent guidance in both documents.a. There are some inconsistences in the definition of what is Routine and Non-Routine in the Tool Box Talk and the JSA Standards.Procedural changes are still pending for these standards as a schedule review is coming up and theformal changes will be made then.2. Communicate through weekly safety notes the requirements for using tag lines. Review rigging training and include proper requirements for tag lines and hazards of using a lifting sling or knotted rope as a tag line. This information was passed on to all MEGPL departments at Punta Europa during the weekly TBT meetings, this included: hand placement, handling loads and glove use.a. During this task a lifting sling was used as a tag line.3. Update the glove assessment matrix to include Deck Handling Operations and the use of impact resistant gloves and include as an appendix in the Personal Protective Equipment Standard.a. Medium duty hand protection was used by personnel performing this activity. Although heavy duty/impact resistant gloves might not have eliminated the injury, it could have reduced the severity. This has been completed by MEGPL HES Supervisor4. Reemphasize the requirement to maintain balance and stability of any lifted load through the HES Weekly Safety Bulletin. Incorporate the method of using chain block/ come along in the rigging training to maintain balance and levelling required for the load. This has been completed by MEGPL.a. Load unbalance and instability due to the use of 2 rigging slings on two opposite corners.5. Update HES 002 LIFTING EQUIPMENT OPERATION POLICY to identify that hands shall not be used to manoeuvre suspended loads. Tasks requiring the hand placement of employees on the load shall be covered by a Permit or JSA which addresses the proper hand protection to be used and identifies risk of pinch points. Training for the rigging team has been conducted and the policy revises to ensure hands free lifting – if there is a situation where a hand needs to be placed on a moving load this is to be separately risk assessed before the task can conducted. Tools for hands free lifting operations have been ordered by MEGPL.a. Hand Placement (Root Cause). It is believed by the investigation team that the Root Cause of the event was the hand placement of the injured party.6. Update the fall protection standard to address design requirement for floor opening protection barriers. Identify the approval authority of the barrier design within the standard. Design to consider a 12 inch clearance around the opening. Communicate change to scaffolders and affected employees.a. Design and location of the scaffolding barrier. No sufficient clearance for the hatch to be put back in place without manual manipulation. (Close proximity to hatch and extended poles above handrail). Purpose built safety barriers for the deck openings have been fabricated which provide the 12 inch clearance from the opening to ensure there is sufficient space to manoeuvre the deck hatches into position for future jobs. The formal updating of the standard will be completed in the schedule review process. 7. Construct three purpose built hatch barriers for the Well Head Access Hatches that bolts together and is constructed to allow 12 inches of clearance around the hatch. More than one may be required as more than one hatch at a time may be removed. The hatch barrier should have no extended uprights. Purpose built safety barriers for the deck openings have been fabricated and are ready for the next use. a. Design and location of the scaffolding barrier. No sufficient clearance for the hatch to be put back in place without manual manipulation. (Close proximity to hatch and extended poles above handrail).8. Develop a communication tool (Video, bulletin, story, etc.) that clearly discusses the areas where the job could have been stopped and injury was eliminated (Focus on hazard recognition, personal responsibility and Stop Work Authority). Incorporate this tool into the Hand Safety Campaign communication.a. Hazard acceptance. Hazard recognition skills and STOP work authority not efficiently utilized.The communication tool is partially complete; Safety bulletins and weekly topics have been produced and sent to all departments to use during the weekly TBT safety meeting. A refresher for this will be distributed w/c 13-FEB-2017. MEGPL HES Department have filmed the video with the IP in 5 different sections, this has been sent to an editor to produce the final version. Once this has been completed this will be shared with all employees.23-NOV-2016IP is to return to his doctor on 19-DEC-2016 for a finalassessment and progress update. If the IP is signed fit for work, the Lost Work Day count will stop at that date.19 DEC 2016IP had a final assessment with the treating physician and was declared fit to return to work on his next scheduled rotation which is 27th December.The Lost Work Days count has stopped and the total days lost was 90 days.Severity/ Potential reviewThe confirmed lost work day count for this incident is 90 days; CAIRS requires a review of cases where the Lost Work Day count exceeds 40 days to determine if the Severity or Potential is to be changed.For this case the Severity and Potential classification of medium is accurate and does not meet the High Severity or Potential requirements defined in SAF/C/9.6High Severity characteristics (Nature of Injury):· OSHA serious injuries; fatalities, amputations and serious burns…o From 2015, OSHA defined the below as severe/ serious injuries (see attached OSHA document):§ Work related fatalities§ Work related inpatient hospitalizations of one of more employees - The IP confirmed that he received day surgery as an outpatientto reposition the bone and insert a t-plate and six screws. He did not stay overnight in the hospital so did no meet the in-patient hospitalizations requirements for a high severity classification. § Work related amputations§ Work related losses of an eye· A health effect or permanent disability from injury/ occupational illness.· Legal exposure/ repercussionsHigh Potential characteristics (Harm to People):· Could probably have caused death - The incident that occurred did not have the potential to cause death.· Potential legal exposure/ repercussions 05-JAN-2017IP returned to his normal work duties. He is due to leave out 02-FEB-2017.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #32368At approximately 11:30 am EST, the WG employee was driving his personal vehicle while performing work as a ROW agent on the ETC Rover Pipeline Project. The roads were wet, due to light rain that occurred sporadically throughout the morning; no ice, as it was about 60 degrees Fahrenheit; and, visibility conditions were good. The incident occurred on a public road, in a rural area; and, typical traffic is fairly sparse. The WG employee involved in the vehicle crash noted that only 4-5 cars passed by the scene of the crash in the hour that was required for local law enforcement to process the incident. The WG employee was driving the vehicle, while a landowner was in the passenger's seat. The WG employee, a ROW agent, was escorting him back to his property, about a 1/4 mile from the future work site. He was attempting to make a left turn into the landowner's property, when he noticed a culvert, which he hadn't seen previously. He stopped momentarily to make an adjustment to avoid hitting the culvert. The entrance to the landowner's property is located below a hillcrest.During the short moment (described as mere seconds) that he was stopped, a vehicle came speeding over the hillcrest, the driver of which slammed on their brakes, and then proceeded to skid/slide down the road about 200 feet before impacting the rear passenger door of the ROW agent's vehicle. As you can see in the attached photo, the damage to the vehicle was relatively minor considering his vehicle was t-boned by oncoming traffic, likely due to the other driver's braking.After making sure all those at the scene of the crash did not require emergency medical attention, the ROW agent notified local law enforcement, his supervisor, and HSSEA of the incident. The ROW agent did not report any injuries or symptoms; however, Axiom was activated and he was evaluated by the Axiom Nurse Case Manager. Only preventative first aid measures (e.g. taking ibuprofen to reduce potential swelling and discomfort) were recommended.The WG employee was not subject to post-incident drug testing as advised by WG's Compliance Team per OSHA's new post-incident drug testing standard (effective 12/1/2016).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #34401On 8-10-2017 at around 02:30 pm MDT Aaron Galvon was involved in an incident that resulted in an injury right middle fingertip area.Aaron stated that he was working on a six inch flange to install insulation kits for Caliber Midstream on the Hay Creek location.Aaron stated that they had struggled on loosening the flange nuts as they were painted and very difficult to loosen. Aaron stated that he was on the underside of the flange with the ratchet while another employee (Billy) was on the upper side assisting to loosen the nuts. Aaron stated that they were about half way complete with that process on that flange when he had his incident. Aaron stated that he had been having a hard time keeping the socket on the bottom side nuts due to the paint that was on them. Aaron stated that is why it was requiring 2 hands on the ratchet and then needing another employee to pull on the upper nuts in attempt to break them free. Aaron stated that his left hand was placed on the socket end of the ratchet to apply pressure to keep it on the nut and the right hand was placed palm up on the end of the ratchet. Aaron also advised me that he had been wearing gloves up to that point but had taken the right one off as the ratchet handle would slip out of a gloved hand (gloves Aaron said were like a mechanic style glove). Aaron stated that when the worker (Billy) on the top nut (positioned on the same work side as Aaron but on his left hand side) applied pressure to loosen the nut the ratchet moved away from him and toward the wheel valve which was next to the flange they had been working on. Aaron stated that his finger then became pinched up against the wheel of the valve and the pressure of the ratchet handle. Aaron stated that out of reaction to the pain he pulled his hand from its trapped location. Aaron did not notice that part of his finger was not intact any longer at first. Aaron stated that he then saw the blood and that is when the crew reacted to the situation and administered First Aid measures and notified appropriate channels.Safety was notified by Clint Wilson (Supervisor) of the incident. Clint explained that the crew said that Aaron chopped the end of his finger off and bone was exposed. Clint also stated that he had just left the location 10 minutes prior to the incident as he was there for a safety stand down that Caliber had put on to ensure the crews stayed safe in their work. Clint said that he was close to the location still and he would go back and haul Aaron to the hospital. I stated that Aaron should be hauled to the Williston ER if Aaron was able to travel that distance as they are better equipped for this type of incident than the local hospitals in the area due to exposed bone.Aaron was transported to Williston ER where he was treated. Safety arrived at the ER and was able to go and speak with Aaron. X-rays were just being taken upon arrival. The doctor stated that the “exposed bone” was in fact just the “fat pad” which is designed to provide cushion on the finger between the bone and skin. The doctor stated that he would not be able to treat the site as Aaron would have to see a specialist for further consultation because in his opinion the area would either need surgery to replace the fat pad and do a skin graft to seal it, or in fact if that could not be done they would have to amputate the fingertip bone back to the first knuckle. The doctor stated that the fingertip bone was not broken from the X-ray that had been taken. Aaron was given a Tetanus shot and an antibiotic shot at the ER. The ER also prescribed antibiotics and Hydrocodone for the pain. The wound was dressed at the ER by using Neosporin, splint to keep it immobile, and wrapped it with gauze. The ER doctor also had called the Minot hand specialist and advised him of the situation who stated to call his office in the morning and he would have Aaron in and evaluate it.On 8-11-17 the specialist had gave Aaron an appointment of 1:00 Central time in Minot at his office. Aaron was transported to Minot ND from Sidney MT by Safety. The doctor came and cleaned the area on Aarons finger and stated that it was not as bad as he thought in the photos he was shown. The finger would not need a surgery or skin graft nor an amputation. The doctor stated that Aaron would just have to apply Aquacel and wrap the finger with gauze to protect it. The doctor explained to Aaron that Aquacel is a dressing that when placed over a wound will adhere to the wound and act as a scab and allow the wound to heal on its own and provide protection. The doctor stated to apply Aquacel twice a day to the area and let the body continue in the healing process. Aaron was told by the doctor to continue taking the antibiotics as prescribed and take the pain medication as needed for pain.The doctor set a follow up appointment of August 21 at 3:30 Central time to re-evaluate the finger to check on the progress.The doctor also stated that Aaron could go back to work but was restricted to no more than 5 pounds with Lifting, Carrying, Pushing, or Pulling with the right hand until next visit and would re-evaluate.Axiom was notified on 8-10-17 of the incident and is in direct contact with Aaron.</td>\n",

The system in use had a fully signed up written scheme of examination for the blast and equipment set up. Immediate corrective action has been taken to assess all other similar set ups TOR set by Client: 1) Is the procedure for testing of zander unit air quality specific in frequency, competence, test equipment, pass/fail criteria? 2) Is the Procedure fully understood by those signing off the blast set-up as safe to use? 3) Are there record sheets for quality test results? 4) What are the Occupational Health limits for air quality delivered by Zander Unit and are these fully understood by all personal involved in blast unit set-up and usage? 5) Are there medical tests for blasters who wear the blasting mask with air delivered by zander unit with usage levels per day? Do we comply? 6) For the set-up in question with suspicion of the air quality being delivered , please provide an actual set of readings from the set-up and confirm these provide no threat to health confirmed by WG occupational health.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The potential source of the respiratory chest infection is extremely difficult to pinpoint. But based on information from the air quality tests, the inspection of the filters, and lack of smell/odours/moisture within the blast hoodduring the work activity, it would seem unlikely that the compressed air system used during the blast activity would be the source, even with high moisture content. Chest infections are usually caused by viruses and bacteria which are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, a compressed air system used for breathing air quality would not normally be considered a source of a respiratory chest infection. The chest infection reported by the blaster has been classified as not work related. To be classified as work related there has to be conclusive evidence that the injury or illness is directly linked to work activities – this has not been possible with any level of assurance in this case. Whilst there has been no clear link identified between the blasting activity and the illness the opportunity has been taken to highlight improvements in the management of blast equipment setups and air quality testing on site.INVESTIGATION FINDINGS and CONCLUSIONS  1) Is the procedure for testing of zander unit air quality specific in frequency, competence, test equipment, pass/fail criteria? Procedure - Yes, there is a WGIS process for testing compressed air quality but it is not being implemented on site. This process for testing air quality is detailed within WGIS procedure (SP24 Respiratory Protective Equipment). Frequency - Breathing Air Quality Checks should be carried out:- Initial equipment set up – before first use, After a compressor has been changed out, After compressor maintenance, After a compressor has been moved even if it has only been moved a short distance, If an end user expresses any concerns, As a requirement of the job specific RA, Where the quality of the breathing air is suspected as being below the required standard, Where an item of the supply circuit such as hoses and filters has been changed out or repaired, Client insistence, Every 3 Months. Competence - Air quality checks must be carried out by a competent person on set up. There was no one trained to use the test equipment on site. Some air quality testing prior to December 2016 had been carried out by the WGIS HSE advisor but this task was not being carried out by anyone on site when he moved to another WGIS contract. The paint team on site were aware that the previous HSE advisor used to do these checks but no one from the paint team had raised any concerns that it was no longer being carried out since his departure. Test equipment - The equipment used by WGIS to test compressed air quality is the Drager Aerotest Alpha. The test equipment was eventually found in the Shell Laboratory where it had been stored for an estimated 12 month period. WGIS purchased a kit for Mossmorran site in Dec 2013 and it was issued to the Advisor on site at that time. Pass/fail criteria - Breathing air quality is to meet the recommendations of BS EN 12021.  Contaminant Maximum Permitted LevelCarbon Monoxide (CO)= 5 ppmCarbon Dioxide (CO2)= 500 ppmOil= 0.5 mg/m3Water= 250 mg/m3Odour / TasteNo significant odour or taste 2) Is the Procedure fully understood by those signing off the blast set-up as safe to use? WGIS have 5 employees on site who are trained and competent to set up and verify blast set ups as per the Written Scheme of Examinations (WSE). Training was conducted on 11/06/2015, certified as being competent on site are Kevin McDougall, David Simmonds, Steven McNeish, Lee Thomson &amp;amp; Andy Lambie. Only these individuals sign off WSE set ups. The WSE procedure is in place to satisfy the requirements of the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations (PSSR), and as such, focuses on the pressure elements of the set up. It does not currently include any requirement to conduct air quality checks as these requirements are detailed within SP24. The permit does not include any reference to air quality checks of compressed air. 3)Are there record sheets for quality test results? As per WGIS procedure SP24 records of air quality checks should be kept for 5 years. It is known that some air quality testing has been carried out prior to December 2016 but historical records of air quality checks could not be located during the investigation process. WGIS form (QR128 Compressed Air Breathing Air Quality Check – Aerotest Alpha Kit) should be used to record all checks. 4)What are the Occupational Health limits for air quality delivered by Zander Unit and are these fully understood by all personal involved in blast unit set-up and usage? All personnel involved are aware how the Niltox filters work. The Niltox purifiers are contained in sealed cartridges and contain the colour change monitor, these are monitored by the site team. No concerns were raised by the site team about the condition of the filters in use. 5)Are there medical tests for blasters who wear the blasting mask with air delivered by zander unit with usage levels per day? Do we comply? Medical tests for blasters are conducted at site annually. The blaster has completed a site medical at Mossmorran on 30th March 2017, during the medical the blaster had a lung function test carried out. Results were poor though not significantly different from 2015. On the blasters completed occupational health questionnaire he had indicated that he had suffered from pneumonia within the last 3 years . Following the assessment, the nurse did not advise for any adjustments to be made to the blasters role and he is presently deemed fit to wear an air fed blast hood. There are no specified usage levels per day for blasters wearing air fed blast hoods. The blasters are advised to alter their work rate according to their own capabilities, rest periods during blasting are taken as per the blasters requirements. This is monitored and enforced by supervision. 6)For the set-up in question with suspicion of the air quality being delivered, please provide an actual set of readings from the set-up and confirm these provide no threat to health confirmed by WG occupational health. When the blast activities were being undertaken on 17th &amp;amp; 18th August 2017 the blaster did not report any issues or concerns relating to excessive moisture, water or smells within his blast hood. He completed the task on both days without stopping work or raising any concerns about the breathing air being provided. An air quality test of the set up being used could not be undertaken in its exact location (T-3401 area) due to elapsed time from the blasting activity being undertaken (17th &amp;amp; 18th August 2017), and the blaster reporting his chest infection (24th August). The equipment by Thursday 24th August had been dismantled and taken away from the T-3401 area. In order to get a comparable air quality test the exact same equipment was set up in the yard at Silverstone Stores. A test was conducted on Monday 28th August. These tests confirmed that, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Oil Mist were below the recommended levels, confirming air being provided through the equipment and filter unit being used was not potentially contaminated. It is difficult to ascertain the exact water vapour level from the test conducted on Monday 28th August as the wrong Drager tube was used for testing. Drager tube: Water Vapour 1/b (part no. 81 01 781) was used instead of Drager tube: Water Vapour 20/a-P (part no. 81 03 061). The tube during the test went off the scale within 2 minutes but this was due to the wrong tube being used. A visual inspection of the filters confirmed that the colour change strips were within the recommended scale for safe use (one had a full blue line and the other had some pink discolouration below the recommended change line). There were no unusual odours, mould or growth evident on any of the filters. There was some indication of potential slight contamination (oil or moisture) on the tip of the colour change strips, but this is not unusual. A WGIS Occupational Hygienist consulted during the investigation states that the presence of moisture within a compressed line for breathing air quality does not represent an immediate risk to health, whereas the presence of CO, CO2 or Oil Mist above certain levels would. The WGIS Occupational Hygienist stated that moisture is more of an issue operationally e.g. moisture in a line can lead to issues with freezing (if certain temperatures are reached), which could in certain conditions lead to line fractures and thus loss of air. Moisture also has the potential for rust to occur. So a visual check at major connections points, threads, tappings, inside filters cartridges would indicate if rust was occurring. Excessive moisture/condensation can lead to microbiological growth, if conditions are good (e.g. correct temperature, food availability etc). This would be rare within a compressed air system though and would be more relevant with standing water.</td>\n",

Frequency - Breathing Air Quality Checks should be carried out:- Initial equipment set up – before first use, After a compressor has been changed out, After compressor maintenance, After a compressor has been moved even if it has only been moved a short distance, If an end user expresses any concerns, As a requirement of the job specific RA, Where the quality of the breathing air is suspected as being below the required standard, Where an item of the supply circuit such as hoses and filters has been changed out or repaired, Client insistence, Every 3 Months. Competence - Air quality checks must be carried out by a competent person on set up. There was no one trained to use the test equipment on site. Some air quality testing prior to December 2016 had been carried out by the WGIS HSE advisor but this task was not being carried out by anyone on site when he moved to another WGIS contract. The paint team on site were aware that the previous HSE advisor used to do these checks but no one from the paint team had raised any concerns that it was no longer being carried out since his departure. Test equipment - The equipment used by WGIS to test compressed air quality is the Drager Aerotest Alpha. The test equipment was eventually found in the Shell Laboratory where it had been stored for an estimated 12 month period. WGIS purchased a kit for Mossmorran site in Dec 2013 and it was issued to the Advisor on site at that time. Pass/fail criteria - Breathing air quality is to meet the recommendations of BS EN 12021.  Contaminant Maximum Permitted LevelCarbon Monoxide (CO)= 5 ppmCarbon Dioxide (CO2)= 500 ppmOil= 0.5 mg/m3Water= 250 mg/m3Odour / TasteNo significant odour or taste 2) Is the Procedure fully understood by those signing off the blast set-up as safe to use? WGIS have 5 employees on site who are trained and competent to set up and verify blast set ups as per the Written Scheme of Examinations (WSE). Training was conducted on 11/06/2015, certified as being competent on site are Kevin McDougall, David Simmonds, Steven McNeish, Lee Thomson &amp;amp; Andy Lambie. Only these individuals sign off WSE set ups. The WSE procedure is in place to satisfy the requirements of the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations (PSSR), and as such, focuses on the pressure elements of the set up. It does not currently include any requirement to conduct air quality checks as these requirements are detailed within SP24. The permit does not include any reference to air quality checks of compressed air. 3)Are there record sheets for quality test results? As per WGIS procedure SP24 records of air quality checks should be kept for 5 years. It is known that some air quality testing has been carried out prior to December 2016 but historical records of air quality checks could not be located during the investigation process. WGIS form (QR128 Compressed Air Breathing Air Quality Check – Aerotest Alpha Kit) should be used to record all checks. 4)What are the Occupational Health limits for air quality delivered by Zander Unit and are these fully understood by all personal involved in blast unit set-up and usage? All personnel involved are aware how the Niltox filters work. The Niltox purifiers are contained in sealed cartridges and contain the colour change monitor, these are monitored by the site team. No concerns were raised by the site team about the condition of the filters in use. 5)Are there medical tests for blasters who wear the blasting mask with air delivered by zander unit with usage levels per day? Do we comply? Medical tests for blasters are conducted at site annually. The blaster has completed a site medical at Mossmorran on 30th March 2017, during the medical the blaster had a lung function test carried out. Results were poor though not significantly different from 2015. On the blasters completed occupational health questionnaire he had indicated that he had suffered from pneumonia within the last 3 years . Following the assessment, the nurse did not advise for any adjustments to be made to the blasters role and he is presently deemed fit to wear an air fed blast hood. There are no specified usage levels per day for blasters wearing air fed blast hoods. The blasters are advised to alter their work rate according to their own capabilities, rest periods during blasting are taken as per the blasters requirements. This is monitored and enforced by supervision. 6)For the set-up in question with suspicion of the air quality being delivered, please provide an actual set of readings from the set-up and confirm these provide no threat to health confirmed by WG occupational health. When the blast activities were being undertaken on 17th &amp;amp; 18th August 2017 the blaster did not report any issues or concerns relating to excessive moisture, water or smells within his blast hood. He completed the task on both days without stopping work or raising any concerns about the breathing air being provided. An air quality test of the set up being used could not be undertaken in its exact location (T-3401 area) due to elapsed time from the blasting activity being undertaken (17th &amp;amp; 18th August 2017), and the blaster reporting his chest infection (24th August). The equipment by Thursday 24th August had been dismantled and taken away from the T-3401 area. In order to get a comparable air quality test the exact same equipment was set up in the yard at Silverstone Stores. A test was conducted on Monday 28th August. These tests confirmed that, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Oil Mist were below the recommended levels, confirming air being provided through the equipment and filter unit being used was not potentially contaminated. It is difficult to ascertain the exact water vapour level from the test conducted on Monday 28th August as the wrong Drager tube was used for testing. Drager tube: Water Vapour 1/b (part no. 81 01 781) was used instead of Drager tube: Water Vapour 20/a-P (part no. 81 03 061). The tube during the test went off the scale within 2 minutes but this was due to the wrong tube being used. A visual inspection of the filters confirmed that the colour change strips were within the recommended scale for safe use (one had a full blue line and the other had some pink discolouration below the recommended change line). There were no unusual odours, mould or growth evident on any of the filters. There was some indication of potential slight contamination (oil or moisture) on the tip of the colour change strips, but this is not unusual. A WGIS Occupational Hygienist consulted during the investigation states that the presence of moisture within a compressed line for breathing air quality does not represent an immediate risk to health, whereas the presence of CO, CO2 or Oil Mist above certain levels would. The WGIS Occupational Hygienist stated that moisture is more of an issue operationally e.g. moisture in a line can lead to issues with freezing (if certain temperatures are reached), which could in certain conditions lead to line fractures and thus loss of air. Moisture also has the potential for rust to occur. So a visual check at major connections points, threads, tappings, inside filters cartridges would indicate if rust was occurring. Excessive moisture/condensation can lead to microbiological growth, if conditions are good (e.g. correct temperature, food availability etc). This would be rare within a compressed air system though and would be more relevant with standing water.</td>\n",

IP(injured employee) was tasked to grind a bevel of a 2\" section of pipe, IP stated that the grinder slipped out of his left hand when he released the head of the grinder with his right hand. The reason that he released the right hand was to switch hands so he could continue beveling the pipe on the other side. When IP realize the grinding wheel cut through his glove and made contact with his finger, he stopped work and notified his immediate supervisor. Supervisor made the appropriate notifications and Axiom was called. Axiom recommended first aid measures of ice, alternating over-the-counter Tylenol and ibuprofen for discomfort, and triple antibiotics.IP is agreeable to the first aid measures and has been instructed to contact Axiom, Safety, or his immediate supervisor if his condition were to change. Preliminary Investigation revealed: Unsafe behavior: IP was gripping the back head of the grinder for control instead of using the handle. Also did not allow the grinding disc to come to a complete stop before switching hands. Corrective Actions: Handles will be used in all required situations and discussed with all crew members in the morning safety stand down meeting.</td>\n",

Elkhorn Pipeline Service’s driver parked the flatbed gooseneck trailer on the North side of Old Mill Rd. next to a bar ditch (borrow ditch). IP (injured person) assisting on offloading, climbed onto the trailer and attached the lifting device. Once the barricaded was successfully unloaded, the IP was standing on the North end of the trailer and lost his balance and jumped down into a bar ditch. IP stated that high wind may have played a factor in him losing his balance, investigation with crew members did reveal that the wind was up to 18 mph. The employee landed on his feet but felt some discomfort in his left ankle. Axiom was notified and determined that the IP suffered an ankle sprain. Axiom recommended that the IP follow first aid measures of ice, ibuprofen and an ace wrap. However, the IP was requesting precautionary x-rays of his ankle. IP was taken to see our occupational medicine clinic where X-ray were taken. X-rays revealed that the IP did not have any fractures and suggested that the IP continue to follow first aid measures. Unsafe Behavior: Truck was parked next to a bar ditch vs. on a flat even surface, causing a work at height hazard. Insufficient BJSA and hazard risk assessment was performed before the task begun. Corrective Actions: Safety stand down was held with all crew members on 10/25/17 discussing what lead up to the incident, and training provided for hazard awareness, unloading trucks, BJSA, working at heights. Follow-up on IPAll, I would like to inform everyone that we have reclassified the sprained left ankle with first aid measures case to a recordable stress fracture to the tibia on his left foot.IP is in good spirits and feeling much better after first aid measures have been applied for the last two days. Twin Rivers Urgent Care, LLC initial view of the x-rays did not show any obvious breaks or fractures to IP’s left ankle area. The x-ray was forwarded to their radiologist for further review, and on 10/26/17 we were notified that he did have a hair line fracture to his left tibia. Occupational provider has recommended the use of a cam boot until the employee can see an orthopedic specialist for further instructions on care.IP is agreeable to the providers recommendations, he has been instructed to continue first aid measures and to report to his immediate supervisor or safety member if his condition were to change.</td>\n",

Foreman said that there may possibly be a foreign body in his eye and he notified the project superintendent and safety. After multiple attempts to wash the IP's eye out, he was taken by safety to visit our optometrist in Greeley, CO. During his visit, the optometrist found and removed a foreign body from his left eye using a cotton swab then recommended that he use over-the-counter lubricating drops. IP is agreeable to the first aid measures and felt immediate relief.The IP has been notified that if his condition were to worsen, he is to contact his immediate supervisor or onsite safety. Unsafe Behavior: During the investigation, the IP stated that as he was grinding the previous day and was wearing spoggles, faceshield and that the guard was in place which was confirmed by foreman but that he felt debris bouncing on his face once or twice. This revealed that the position of the guard was ejecting the debris from the guard onto his shirt then into the faceshield area. Corrective Actions: Superintendent will be holding a meeting with his welders and helpers to discuss the proper use and placement of the guard.</td>\n",

As the IP approached the wellsite area he also noticed at COP Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite, a C&amp;amp;J Oil Hauling truck was transferring oil from one of the wellsite storage tanks.The IP changed his intended destination from COP Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite and instead, pulled into the COP 274 wellsite to discuss the cam lock maintenance issue with the Select Water Hauler employee. After discussing the cam lock issue with the Select Water Hauler employee, IP leaves the COP 274 wellsite and drove over to the close by COP Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite, ½ mile away.At 8:28 am, IP entered the Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite to resolve the reported issue on the cam lock. Upon arriving, IP parked his vehicle at an angle behind the C&amp;amp;J truck (reported at a distance between 15’ to 20’). IP stated that he purposely parked his vehicle in this manner to be visible to the C&amp;amp;J driver via the side view mirror.IP exited his vehicle and began reaching into the driver side door panel compartment to retrieve a wrench. As IP reached for the wrench, IP noticed the C&amp;amp;J truck reversing towards his vehicle. Given the position the IP was in and the minimal time IP had to get out of the way of the reversing vehicle, IP jumped back into the cab of his vehicle to avoid contact by the reversing C&amp;amp;J truck.The IP did not manage to get his left leg completely into the safety of his truck cabin before the C&amp;amp;J truck made contact with IP vehicle. Contact caused IP vehicle door to close on the IP left leg, pinning IP left leg between the driver side door and cab frame. IP repeatedly honked his vehicle horn, in an attempt to gain the attention of the C&amp;amp;J driver. The C&amp;amp;J driver did not react to the IP vehicle horn and continued reversing the C&amp;amp;J truck. The C&amp;amp;J Water Hauling vehicle pushed IP vehicle across the caliche, before stopping and pulling forward (away from the IP vehicle and incident location).Once the C&amp;amp;J truck pulled forward, IP assumed the C&amp;amp;J driver was then aware of the contact. However the C&amp;amp;J driver continued to pull forward and proceeded to attempt a U-turn maneuver, onward to exiting the wellsite (possibly still unaware of the contact made between the two vehicles). IP began to wave his hands and continued honking his horn to bring attention to the C&amp;amp;J driver.As the C&amp;amp;J driver completed his U-turn, IP successfully gained the attention of the C&amp;amp;J driver. C&amp;amp;J driver exited his vehicle and began to pry the IP door open, freeing the IP pinned leg.Calls were then made from the incident location to report the incident and to plan transport of the IP to a clinic for medical treatment. A COP Operator was called to drive IP from incident location to Xstreme MD in Cuero, TX.IP was diagnosed with a fractured tibia to his left leg by attending medical personnel based at the visiting clinic (Xstreme MD).

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #33850At 7:20 am, a Wood Group Employee (IP) received a maintenance call from a Select Water Hauler employee, advising him of an issue with a cam lock at the ConocoPhillips (COP) Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite.IP accepted accountability to remedy the reported cam lock issue and began to drive from the COP Yorktown office to the Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite (cam lock location).Around 8:00 am, while en-route to the Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite, IP noticed the Select Water Hauler employee who originally called in the maintenance request, had moved onto another nearby COP wellsite, COP Hilmer Koopman 274, 4,5,6,7 wellsite (COP 274).The COP wellsite COP 274 is positioned less than a ½ mile from the COP Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite, where the cam lock issue had been previously reported by the Select Water Hauler employee (on the other side of FM 108). As the IP approached the wellsite area he also noticed at COP Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite, a C&amp;amp;J Oil Hauling truck was transferring oil from one of the wellsite storage tanks.The IP changed his intended destination from COP Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite and instead, pulled into the COP 274 wellsite to discuss the cam lock maintenance issue with the Select Water Hauler employee. After discussing the cam lock issue with the Select Water Hauler employee, IP leaves the COP 274 wellsite and drove over to the close by COP Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite, ½ mile away.At 8:28 am, IP entered the Hilmer Koopman 1 wellsite to resolve the reported issue on the cam lock. Upon arriving, IP parked his vehicle at an angle behind the C&amp;amp;J truck (reported at a distance between 15’ to 20’). IP stated that he purposely parked his vehicle in this manner to be visible to the C&amp;amp;J driver via the side view mirror.IP exited his vehicle and began reaching into the driver side door panel compartment to retrieve a wrench. As IP reached for the wrench, IP noticed the C&amp;amp;J truck reversing towards his vehicle. Given the position the IP was in and the minimal time IP had to get out of the way of the reversing vehicle, IP jumped back into the cab of his vehicle to avoid contact by the reversing C&amp;amp;J truck.The IP did not manage to get his left leg completely into the safety of his truck cabin before the C&amp;amp;J truck made contact with IP vehicle. Contact caused IP vehicle door to close on the IP left leg, pinning IP left leg between the driver side door and cab frame. IP repeatedly honked his vehicle horn, in an attempt to gain the attention of the C&amp;amp;J driver. The C&amp;amp;J driver did not react to the IP vehicle horn and continued reversing the C&amp;amp;J truck. The C&amp;amp;J Water Hauling vehicle pushed IP vehicle across the caliche, before stopping and pulling forward (away from the IP vehicle and incident location).Once the C&amp;amp;J truck pulled forward, IP assumed the C&amp;amp;J driver was then aware of the contact. However the C&amp;amp;J driver continued to pull forward and proceeded to attempt a U-turn maneuver, onward to exiting the wellsite (possibly still unaware of the contact made between the two vehicles). IP began to wave his hands and continued honking his horn to bring attention to the C&amp;amp;J driver.As the C&amp;amp;J driver completed his U-turn, IP successfully gained the attention of the C&amp;amp;J driver. C&amp;amp;J driver exited his vehicle and began to pry the IP door open, freeing the IP pinned leg.Calls were then made from the incident location to report the incident and to plan transport of the IP to a clinic for medical treatment. A COP Operator was called to drive IP from incident location to Xstreme MD in Cuero, TX.IP was diagnosed with a fractured tibia to his left leg by attending medical personnel based at the visiting clinic (Xstreme MD). IP was referred to an Orthopedic Doctor for further evaluation.IP was evaluated and discharged from an Orthopedic Clinic on 5/15/17, confirming diagnosis of fractured left tibia with blistering. IP scheduled a follow up visit on 5/23/17.5/23/17 (eight days after the original incident occurred), IP attended a follow up appointment with the Orthopedic Clinic. IP was directed by Orthopedic Clinic to be admitted to Hospital for treatment of a skin infection that formed on his left leg (related to the original injury).5/26/17 Wood Group (WG) Management organize a Conference call Meeting with members of the C&amp;amp;J Energy Services Management Team. WG attempt to confirm interview access to C&amp;amp;J employee who was directly involved in the vehicle incident, as previous attempts had been unsuccessful. WG explained that OSHA had been in contact and had requested further incident related information. WG proposed C&amp;amp;J management would receive a copy of the OSHA questionnaire material and an offer to undertake a joint interview of the C&amp;amp;J driver. Additionally WG would request OSHA extend the deadline to be able to include the added incident related information in the submitted incident investigation report.5/31/17 C&amp;amp;J Energy Services, notify WG Management, that the offer of a joint investigation was not acceptable. WG Management would not be given access to the C&amp;amp;J Energy Services employee for interview. Furthermore C&amp;amp;J Energy Services intend to complete their own investigation separate of the WG incident investigation effort.6/1/17, IP was discharged from the treating hospital.OSHA Case number: UPA 121-88-55.OSHA questionnaire completed and delivered on 6/9/2017.</td>\n",

He had removed shrink sleeve from the pipe and sandblasted the bare metal. He was going to use Acetone to clean the pipe and remove moisture from metal surface. Employee B went to job to get the Acetone and poured the Acetone into an improperly labeled water bottle. Employee B handed the water bottle containing Acetone down to Employee A in the trench box. Employee A partially used the Acetone and put bottle aside. Then he continued prepping the pipe for coating. He had 4-5 bottles of water in the trench box with him that he had drunk from. He got thirsty and saw a bottle with liquid and attempted to drink it. That bottle was the improperly labeled bottle containing Acetone. When he started to drink from it, the Acetone made contact with his mouth and tongue and a small amount got in his mouth. He spat the Acetone out, left the bell hole, and went to his truck to get water to swish his mouth out. He swished several times and spat it out. The job supervisor and equipment operator both observed his actions of returning to his truck and went to see what happened. They had him continue to swish his mouth out. They asked if he wanted medical attention which he refused, saying that only a small amount got in his mouth, and he had not swallowed any of it. They broke for lunch, he ate his lunch and they observed him to check for any kind of reaction to the Acetone. They asked again if he wanted to get medical attention which he refused again. After about an hour and a half, they let him resume work with no ill effects.</td>\n",

There had been a previous oil spill during the removal of a flange from the gearbox which was cleaned up by our sub-contractor, MAS Installations.Since MAS left the gearbox in the storage area, there had been afurther leak discovered by site personnel. The oil spill was a concern to the customer as they were not aware of it until it was found the following day.During the execution of the work the removal of the existing gearbox was problematic due to rusting on the shaft. As spare gearboxes were available in the customer’s barrel roof area, a replacement flange was removed from one of these spares. It was during this activity that the initial oil spill was noticed. Oil had spilled out of the point where the flange is attached to the gearbox so the gearbox was re-positioned to avoid further leaks and the spill was cleaned up by MAS Installations. It is now known that due to the re-positioning of the gearbox to stop the initial spill, oil has been able to escape from the gearbox breather/filling point due to the position it was left in.As the initial leak was not reported to the customer, they were not in a position to monitor or move the gearbox to prevent the secondary spillage of oil. Failure to report the spill to the customer had resulted in Philips Avent raising the incident internally as a near miss and have asked ATG to also review the incident for lessons learned.</td>\n",

However the training does not include the reversing of trailer units. A standby man was in place correctly at the rear of the trailer as his main task is to prevent the vehicle/s impacting a pedestrian or stationary object. Therefore the Standby man was not situated to help the driver. The location of the task was not in close proximity to process plant. Local procedures require a standby man to be in place for reversing in any location and any movement ( reversing or forwards) with 5m of process plant. See attached photographs</td>\n",

One of the platforms instrument technicians discovered this when he began his shift shortly after 06:00 in the morning. Internet connection was not great during nightshift but there was no real reason for the nightshift CRO to think that anything was wrong other than a poor internet connection which is often normal off shore.The instrument technician attempted to restore communications by rebooting the modems, these came back on line and looked to be operating normally but the platform still had no Comms.A phone message was left with WG IT using the platform Sat phone, they contacted the platform shortly afterwards advising that we contact Europasat who are our network provider.The Instrument technician contacted Europasat who informed him that we had used up our Monthly allowance. This was reported back to the OIM who managed to contact WG onshore support at approx. 08:00 using the Sat phone.Normal Comms were established at 10:31.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #34487Safety was notified by project superintendent, while retrieving an 8\" steel bore pipe, the bore rig came in contact with a marked 4\" water line. After pot holing bore to find out where the water line was broken, the crew noticed that the bore was supposed to be 11 1/2' deep but instead was approximately at 3 1/2' deep. The water line was immediately shut down while pot holing took place. There were no injuries to any employee or damaged to any equipment.Preliminary investigation revealed that the bore logs read the bore to be at the proper depth range of 10 1/2' to 11 1/2'. Company owned bore rig has been placed out of service until investigation has been completed finding the reason for the miscommunication between the bore head transmitter and the hand held receiver box. 4\" water line is in process of being fully exposed and repaired.Final investigation revealed that the Boring machine was within standards for completing the bore. Vermeer Boring services along with Elkhorn’s bore expert arrived at the machine and tested all boring electronics to see if they were in standards. Vermeer found nothing wrong with the locator or transmitter. After discussing the bore with the crew, it is determined that the bore was done in three parts: 1: Pilot bore: This stage is where the boring crew makes the first pilot bore for the bore. It is monitored to track the transmitter in the head of the boring rod and a receiver that is on the surface. Data was checked and bore pipe was at the appropriate depth that it was indicated to be2: Reamer: After the initial pilot bore was completed the boring crew installed a 10” reamer to make the bore hole large enough for the 8” pipe. The reamer was pulled through the bore and pushed back to continue on with the next step3. Second reamer: After the 10” reamer was pushed back through the bore, the crew installed a 14” reamer and pulled it through the pilot bore. After the 14” reamer exited the bore, the operator started to push the reamer back through the bore. This reamer was not designed to be pushed back through the pilot bore, it is only designed to pull. When the reamer started to be pushed, it did not stay in the pilot bore, it rerouted itself and made its own path. It still exited the pilot bore, but it changed paths in the process.</td>\n",

No injuries were sustained. EO and Swamper were tasked to excavate a ditch using a Trackhoe heading south to north with 4 marked line crossings. Both EO and Swamper had previously dug and crossed the same lines 4 days prior, approximately 10' to the west, all the lines were potholed to identify depth. Once they reached their final 3\" gas line crossing, the Swamper went to the center of the ditch and attempted to use a probe to break the dirt and hand dig the line but the dirt was too hard so he went over to the west side of the ditch and was successful on probing the line to verify depth and hand dug with a shovel to expose the line on the west side of the ditch. EO and Swamper coordinated that EO would take off approximately 18\" off the top since the line was 5' in depth to the top of the pipe then undermine the line so rest would slough off to hand dig and successfully cross the line. As the EO went under the line he rolled the bucket away from the line and made contact with the line, causing a small hole on the bottom of the line. The client is the owner of the damaged line and stated that the 3\" line was under 100 PSI of gas and went to a dead leg from a tank battery that was recently eliminated. When contact was made the EO, Swamper, and client inspector immediately shut off ignition sources and proceeded upwind to make the proper notifications. The line was immediately shut down and vented out, by the client. Line blew down in approximately 10 minutes at a very low pressure. Client has stated that the line is scheduled to be abandoned and removed, and are scheduling for Elkhorn Pipeline Service to perform the task. The line will remain shut down until we abandon it. Both EO and Swamper have successfully performed over 25 line crossings on this project alone. Preliminary investigation has revealed that complacency may have been a factor resulting in the line strike. Although the same EO and Swamper had successfully crossed this same line days prior, additional precautions of fully hand digging the line may have been an alternate route to ensure that the 2' distance away from known lines rule was not breached. Both the EO and Swamper will not participate in excavation operations for the following two days. Both employees will be retrained on excavating on, or near, underground utilities before being put back to any type of underground work.

After WF lined up his crew to perform the 8\" tie-ins, he took his helper over to the East Side Frontage Rd of highway 76 and CR 41. After walking the area down for tomorrow's task, he decided to operate a Trackhoe using his helper as a spotter to make an access road for the work area so the welding rigs could drive into location. Then he decided to get a head start on the next day’s task and excavate a 4' ditch from the bore bell hole heading east towards the property fence line where they would fabricate and install a 2\" vent line from the bore casing. As he was performing the excavation he felt something and retracted the bucket, he made contact with a 3\" gas line causing minor damage to the pipe. Work was immediately stopped and the proper notifications were made.The 3\" line was shut down and vented by the utility owner as a precaution. One calls were in place and valid. Utility owner has evaluated the damage to the pipe, they have agreed to have Elkhorn Pipeline Services to perform the repairs.Preliminary investigation has revealed that although WF has experience as an operator but he is not certified to operate a Trackhoe and excavate through Elkhorn's/ Wood Group's policies. He has not received the appropriate training and documentation to perform a thorough pre-dig walk through. The documentation is available at the lay down office trailer for all equipment operators. The pipe was previously potholed where the line strike occurred but was backfilled to create a berm to control the accumulating rain water in the area. Also 50' to the north of the line strike there was a Carsonite underground gas line warning sign, 98' feet to the south there was another Carsonite sign with yellow pin flags in between. Some of the flags were covered by weeds and dirt from the spoil pile.Immediate corrective actions: WF is not to operate equipment until he has been certified and received the appropriate training. The Job-site has schedule a safety stand to discuss the breakdown of this incident, notify all personnel that they are not to backfill any potholes, personnel are not to operate equipment unless they have been certified for that specific piece of equipment.</td>\n",

At approximately 10:30 we had concluded a full section of the pipelines needed at each section wanted. As we finished I told the crew to go ahead and tie-in all the p/l hits and features in the area. I proceeded to pick up all the equipment and unscrew the big rods put together while crew members continued to tie-in with GPS and book all the information in the field book. Whenfinished picking up the equipment crew chief proceeded to walk to an above grade PVC pipe that he had seen earlier, at that point it seem to be that it was heading due north. Crew Chief returned to the truck and picked up a 4 foot long probe rod and return to the location, he lined up with the pipe and proceeded to make a pilot hole so that it would hold water. He lifted the rod to about chest high and brought it back to the ground while observing the ground for the spot he was aiming for. When the rod hit the ground at a depth of 2 tenths he heard a gushing sound and water began to come out of the ground, at first a small bit and then it began to gush at a harder speed reaching to a height of about 15 foot. While all this was happening the crew was shooting in with GPS, crew chief turned to them and let them know that he had hit a plastic line and it ruptured. A call was made to Survey Supervisor,Matt West, at 11:18 and he was informedwhat had just happened, he toldour crewto stay away from the immediate leak area and to wait for further instructionsSupervisor was notified at 11:18 am of a water line being struck while probing for pipelines in the Anchorage facility.Crew also notified the supervisor at the facility of what had happened and were told to leave the water on until someone could get there to fix it. Field Supervisor told the crew to get out of that area not knowing what kind of water it was. Exxon’s Operations made a call to a contractor to fix the waterline and completed the task at 5:30 pm.</td>\n",

EO and Spotter/Swamper were tasked by the welders on location to remove a minor amount of additional soil/water that had accumulated in the bottom of the bellhole. The welders were getting ready to perform tie-ins, and needed to remove the extra accumulated water and soil in order to safely access the weld location and install a water (trash) pump. The welders gave the request to remove the soil/water to EO and Spotter/Swamper as they were on location with a Trackhoe to assist the welders with lowering in the fabricated tie-in spool. All that needed to be removed from the ditch was one bucket worth of material, and in part, without further planning, or hazard assessment, EO and Spotter/Swamper agreed the soil/water that had accumulated was an issue, and proceeded to remove it with the bucket. This action taken by EO and Spotter/Swamper caused the bucket of the Trackhoe to be placed within the 2’ radius of the 8” steel line. Upon scooping the material into the bucket, Spotter/Swamper gave the “all stop”, closed fist, visual order because the backside of the bucket was getting too close to the pipe. EO stopped the machine momentarily, and then began to curl his bucket away from the line; in doing so the accessory eyelet on the back of the bucket grazed the fusion bond epoxy (FBE) coating on the steel line. It is important to note that the integrity and metallurgy of the steel line was not affected in anyway, and the damage was solely coating based. Operations were immediately ceased, and the crew contacted Supervisor immediately. Supervisor contacted safety and his manager immediately. Operations were ceased until an investigation by the Safety Team and Project Management could be completed. A Safety Stand Down was completed, and lead, by Area Manager and the Safety Team after the onsite investigation was completed. Coating will be fixed tomorrow morning. EO and Spotter/Swamper were both given three (3) days off without pay until further action can be decided upon after the complete investigation.</td>\n",

The 4phase engineers immediately notified the deck foreman and incident had occurred and he instructed the crane operator to situate the compressor back onto the deck. It was subsequently lifted away from the area.Further investigation and discussion with the platform revealed that the deck crew carried out their work in line with procedures which included full communication with the 4phase team on what was happening and where they should be positioned during the lift being undertaken. The deck crew werecommended for this from the IE on board.It was identified that the line in question was on the outside of the control cabin when it should have been on the inside to protect from potential impact during lifting operations.It was identified that the load had spun as opposed to being picked up and swung round which was out of the control of the deck crew.The reporting from both sides was commended during this incident and the damage was corrected and the work commenced within the platform.</td>\n",

Group attended the morning meeting at approximately 07:00, gathered materials at the yard then proceeded to install fencing at the ROW north of WCR 31 and Highway 392.At approximately 08:30 Foreman working in the laydown contacted EO to assist offloading pipe at the NMS yard located Southeast of WCR 43 and WCR 66. Additional Employee (labor) and Involved Employee (labor) were given a ride back to the yard by EO. Upon arrival additional worker (labor) began to assist Foreman on unloading the pipe. EO notified his WCF that he was not feeling well (personal issue) and would like to go home for the day. EO notified Involved Employee that he was receiving a ride home from WCF and allowed Involved Employee to utilize his truck (Grey GMC truck; non ECI company truck, personal leased vehicle) for the day because the fencing material was in his truck bed.At approximately 10:00 Involved Employee was driving alone westbound on WCR 66, heading back to the ROW. He came to the intersection of WCR 43 and WCR 66 and performed a complete stop with no issues. As he was coming to the next intersection of WCR 66 and WCR 41 he attempted to apply the brakes, he stated that the brake pedal went down to the floor board and did work. He started to pump the pedal with no success. Knowing that he was going to pass through stop sign and the traffic heading Northbound/Southbound did not have a stop sign, he glanced over to the northbound traffic and saw no approaching vehicles. He attempted to glance over to the southbound traffic and his view was obstructed by trees, as the Grey GMC truck passed through the stop sign a white Chevy pickup (Non-employee) was heading southbound and would make contact with the passenger side of the grey GMC (EO’s leased truck, not Elkhorn company truck) that employee was driving. Employee attempted to veer to his left to give the white Chevy some clearance to avoid him. The white Chevy's front driver side made contact with the passenger mid-section of the grey GMC. After contact was made, the GMC was forced off to the south end of WCR 66, once the tires left the pavement onto the edge of the road way the truck rolled over approximately two times ( Colorado State Patrol traffic report revealed that the vehicle made a 1/4 turn onto its driverside, Please seeadditional noted added below.)and came to a standstill on the driver side when it made contact with a power line post. Both vehicles were deemed inoperable. White Chevy also came to a rolling stop on the Southside of WCR 66.Employee exited his vehicle and met with the driver of the white Chevy.

Previously on 08/05/17 there had been a spill to sea from the turbine return line from the diesel day tank (See Cairs Report 33810 Diesel leak from E Turbine return line). The platform were in the process of draining down the day tank to allow the return line spade to be removed following pressure testing.The Turbine diesel tank was feeding the LV generator in order to lower the tank level prior to switching over to its own tank. The reason for lowering the storage in the tank was to allow isolation to be put in place so the return line spade could be removed following pressure testing.The day tank low level alarm came in on the TDC but the level was still above the feed line to the LV generator. Final preparations were being made to switch over to the LV generator designated fuel supply when the generator shutdown on lack of adequate fuel supply. On further investigation, it was found that although the fuel level remained above the feed nozzle on the tank, there was insufficient fluid head to push the fuel all the way to the LV generator and through the filtration system and onwards to the engine. The AP emergency generator was isolated for service so not availableThe AD emergency generator tried to start but failed due to sticking control relay’s. Following several failed attempts to start in Auto, the air start vessel depleted preventing further starts until the system was recharged using the top up diesel compressor.

The 2 operatives had received there job start briefing from their scaffold supervisor Jason Boyce and hadsigned onto the relevant paperwork and Permit to work.As the scaffolders carried out their task they were meet by theExxonMobil Operations Manager who noted a couple of observations at the time. The Operations Manager noted that :\"As I was walking past the 2 scaffolders erecting this structure I noted a standalone ladder leaning against the instrument shelter but adjacent to the scaffold, and wondered what it was doing there, as it was not lashed or tied to anything. I turned around and walked back around the scaffold to try and see if there was an obvious means of access for the 2 scaffolders who were working on the first lift at about 3m high. There was no other means of access to that level, so I stopped and asked the SSMP scaffolder how he had gained access to that level, to which he replied, “up that ladder”. I asked why it wasn’t tied or lashed to the structure and whether it should be, and was told it didn’t need to be, and anyway they needed to be able to remove it at the end of the day to prevent other people from accessing what would be an incomplete scaffold. I challenged this but he maintained it didn’t need to be secured. At that moment his colleague (green hat) began descending the ladder back down to grade. The ladder was clearly not supported, nor footed by another person. Dissatisfied with his response I returned to the admin building to seek advice and interrogate the trade standards documents SG 4:15 and TG:20, and reporting the observation to the Wood Group site manager\"After the Operations Manager from Exxon discussed his concerns with the WGISsite manager.The WGIS Site managerand scaffold supervisor conducted a Near Loss Investigation which identified a client WAH LSR breech, both operatives were then suspended and escorted from site</td>\n",

       "      <td>Migrated from Legacy Cairs Incident #32124Incident took place on the 19th February 2017 at the Queen Margaret Drive site for Barratt Homes .Investigation currently ongoing as of the 20th January 2017 (08:00am).Initial investigationsuggests a Wood Group operative had accessed a loaded forklift truck at height toremove rope that had been securing the plettac scaffoldingboards. This had beenout with the confines of the scaffold working platform. The operative had been witnessed by a member of the clients HSE team carrying out the unsafe act whilst not being hooked on by the operatives fall protection system.Further investigation required with theinterview of the woodgroup operative to be held early next week..Revised as of 07-02-2017On the 19th January 2017 WGIS Operatives had began their day by carrying out typical man in attendance duties consisting of light scaffold alterations ,and hop up movements using Plettac System Scaffolding. After these duties had been completed the 2 scaffold operatives had been tasked by the client to carry out scaffold erection on the townhouse projects.This consisted of the scaffolders erecting the 5th lift scaffold run on the north elevation of the town houses at plot 4-5.The previous day had consisted of erecting the skeleton lift on level 5 which would have been the standards, ledgers and advanced guardrails.During the start of the morning appx 8:00am William McDonald had requested to the forklift driver the need for boards and for the FLT to assist with the lift which is a client ,WGIS contract requirement.To complete their activity the scaffolders required further plettac boards to erect at the 5th level. These boards would be transported by the site controlled forklift truck and boomed to height for operatives to manual hand onto the scaffold. The operatives had carried out their task of erecting additional scaffold material at level 5 until the FLT could supply the workface with decks. At 09:50am - 10:00am the scaffold operatives had been finishing up for their morning break when the FLT had become available to assist on the lifting of scaffold boards to the 4th level to allow the scaffolders to removethe required boards they needed to complete the lift above.The FLT hadpicked up a pallet of plettac stage boards which consisted of 40 boards (10boards high x 4 boards wide). The boards were secured together by 2 lengths of blue polyprop rope and had been secured with slip knots.This would be enough boards to erect the deck above.As the FLT boomed out the load to the required height the FLT operator positioned the forks so they had slightly protruded onto the advanced guardrail to which had been said was a normal method. On this occasion the FLT Operator had landed the forks on the mid handrail of the advanced guardrail rather than the lift ledger itself this meant that the top of the boards were at a greater height than normal.Due to the ground position of the forklift truck theload had came in at an angle rather than parallel with the scaffold bay also.Once the load had been placed in situation William McDoanld WGIS Scaffolder began toremove the ropes that had been securing the scaffold boards. The first rope had been removed with ease as it had been tied off correctly andwas positioned at the front of the load (top of the boards) closest to the scaffold. The second rope had been secured on the opposite end of the load of boards which now meant that the release point of the knot was to the back of thePlettac boards furthest point away from the scaffold.William McDonald proceeded to climb onto themid hand rail point where he initially loosened the knot but it got stuck on the Plettac boards and William then hooked on to the back ledger where he then elevated himself onto the top handrail and placed a knee onto the boards itself. William was able to remove the knot and rope from the Plettac boards.At the point where William elevated himself onto the tophandrail and reached out to the rope the Barratt HomesHSE Advisor spotted William out on the boards and shouted at William through the site office window to get down and stop what he was doing.There had been no further inspection of the work area carried out by The HSE Advisor and William and James stopped what they were doing at went for the morning break.William had returned from his break and spoke withBarratts HSE Advisor Stuart Pontin who said Billy should have known better as he was a supervisor for Wood group and should have displayed better practice.William and James carried out the remainder of the shift without any further influence from the HSE Advisor. At approximately 17:00pm John McCall Senior Operation manager for Wood group received a phone call from Barratt Homes West Construction Director Craig McFarlane of the working atheight issue that his Hse Advisor had witnessed and asked JMc to look into the incident. Stuart Carson WGIS HSE Advisor received a phone call from JohnMcCall about the issues and that an investigation was required to determinewhat had happened. Due to the nature of the working at height incident William McDonald was suspended pending further investigation. Stuart Carson was on site o Friday morning at 08:00amFriday the 20st of January 2017 to commence the investigation.</td>\n",

As it fell, it struck a piece of structure and ricocheted sideways, falling a further 7m to grade and landing outside the barricaded exclusion zone. This resulted in an overall fall of approximately 17m. No persons were in the area at the time of the incident, and no damage to plant was identified.The Root Cause identified was that the use of the bucket was inappropriate, as it was not an enclosed lifting device and if upturned could not retain its contents. The recommendation was made to obtain certified lifting bags with securable lids to prevent any future similar dropped object incidents during lifting activities.Several contributing factors were also identified;- There was no spotter in place during the hoisting of the bucket. - The permit for the activity had failed to capture all of the relevant hazards, such as dropped object prevention.There was a breakdown in communication during the lift, where the contractor who was hoisting the bucket was doing so blind, and there was no spotter provided to inform him that the bucket was about to contact the structure and upturn.The permit and the accompanying risk assessment for the workscope failed to take into account any requirement for dropped object prevention of handtools, or the potential use of a lifting system, despite the work location being known to be 10m above a landing platformA recommendation was made to provide the work team with dropped objects prevention training, focussing on the use of tool lanyards, secondary retention, and proper lifting/hoisting techniques. A recommendation was also made to challenge the level of detail on permits and their accompanying task analysis by conducting more regular permit audits of workgroups in the field.A further recommendation was made to conduct a risk assessment of all lifting/hoisting tasks that are commonly performed on that site by that team, to enable for a greater level of risk awareness and understanding of specific controls required for those tasks to be identified and if possible documented.Description of the eventOn 20 of April 2017 at 10.45am, two Wood Group E&amp;amp;I technicians (one Senior, one Junior - 4 months in service) were required to reinstall a thermowell from a pipe forming part of the polymer tower. This structure consists of a landing platform 7m above grade, with the thermowell housing located near a walkway 10.7m above the landing platform, accessible by a vertical ladder from the landing platform. The activity was being performed during shutdown maintenance activities, with a non-Wood Group contractor work party also performing work on the tower. To assist their workscope, this contractor work party had set up a hoisting system using a rope pulley and bucket to lift items from the landing platform to the walkway above. As part of this system they had bunting in place to exclude the landing platform when lifts were being performed. Typically this work party performed hoists with the contractor on the landing platform acting as a spotter, as the contractor above had limited visibility below the walkway from the hoist position.On this day, the Senior Wood Group technician ascended to the walkway to inspect the thermowell location, and discovered it was filled with hardened polymer so that he was unable to reinstall the thermowell until the polymer had been scraped away. To do this he needed a longer instrument than the screwdriver he had brought with him. He asked the Junior Wood Group technician located below on the landing platform to source him a longer tool for scraping, and the crowbar was identified. To avoid carrying the crowbar while ascending the fixed ladder, they decided to seek assistance from one of the contractor employees working nearby on the walkway and use the hoist system that was set up. The Junior E&amp;amp;I technician placed the crowbar into the bucket and then lashed it to the bucket handle to prevent it toppling out while the bucket was upright. Junior E&amp;amp;I technician then checked that the pre-established platform level exclusion zone was clear of workers, and the Senior E&amp;amp;I Technician informed the shutdown subcontractor worker to hoist the bucket up slowly. However, once the lift began, the Junior E&amp;amp;I technician moved under some structure to be out of the line of fire below the load, whilst the Senior E&amp;amp;I technician went back to inspecting the pipe and polymer that needed removing. The subcontractor, while hoisting, did not have line of sight on the bucket as it was being lifted. This meant that there was no spotter observing the bucket as it was being hoisted up to the walkway.As the bucket approached the walkway level, it struck a C-bracket, swayed, became unbalanced and upturned. The crowbar was then dislodged from the knot, and dropped towards the platform level. As the crowbar fell it struck a temporary scaffold in place for the shutdown, ricocheted sideways, and eventually landed at grade a further 7m below the platform. There was no one in the immediate vicinity at grade, however this area was not barricaded or part of any exclusion zone.No persons were in the area at the time of the incident, and no damage to plant was identified.Work was ceased and the incident reported immediately.</td>\n",

Upon isolated, the electric cables were removed and motor was uncoupled from pump as the motor needs to be hoisted up to make way for pump removal.The total height of the vertical pump and motor was approximately 2m in height and the area was constraint, it is not possible to erect a scaffold as such WG MT had placed an aluminium A frame ladder on the grating while the other two ladder footing was on a plywood laid on grating and the ladder was held by co-WG MT to gain height access for rigging of motor sling onto chain block hook. As the ladder was short, WG MT had climbed up to the top rung and had positioned himself on top of pump motor to rig the motor lifting belt onto the chain block hook. During this moment WG MT had exposed himself to a 2m fall.Upon rigging of motor sling onto chain block hook, WG MT then descend to platform grating, then the motor was hoisted to another position using another chain block and it was placed on a motor frame and was left there and then commenced on pump removal.

This was conducted in readiness for installation of special tooling between the inboard arm and base riser.To enable access to the point of special tooling installation, a scaffold 'hop-up' platform was constructed. Inboard (rear/northside) handrail components of the scaffold were removed so that the MLA could be manoeuvred into position. The Area Operator moved to arm accordingly and once instructed by the Work Supervisor that it was in the correct position, switched the ‘arm selector’ control pendant to ‘N’ position and instated a hydraulic own isolation (at 35BAV039, 35BAV045 &amp;amp; 35BAV046). This was followed by an observation period of a few minutes to determine that the arm was settled. Note: the slew lock was engaged thus preventing horizontal movement of the arm.Handrail re-instatement was required to enable fitting of the special tooling. As such, a scaffold team member locked onto the hydraulic own isolation hasp and was approved to commence related works by the Work Supervisor, who was the Performing Authority. Shortly after accessing the scaffold, and whilst standing beside the arm (not in the ‘line of fire’ / movement path of the MLA), the MLA was witnessed by a number of personnel to have moved towards the balanced, 'stored' position. Upon noticing this, the Work Supervisor instructed the scaffold team member to depart the scaffold so that the arm could be re-positioned.*Close-out deadline extended to reflect due dates of 2x corrective actions.</td>\n",

No injuries to any employee or no damage to equipment. Surrounding employees stated that the boom did not contact the power line nor did the line move after the breaker kicked off.Unsafe behavior: preliminary investigation revealed that the flagging was not installed at the minimum 10' approach distance to an energized power line. Flagging was installed only on one side of the power lines but not on the other for the second piece of equipment.Corrective Actions: Safety stand down with crew members was held to remind them to install flagging for energized lines at a minimum of 10' or more depending on the kilovolts and if not possible then further actions will be discussed. Met with all operators and spotters to discuss the standards for the areas around power lines and what they need to be looking for.

The scope of work involved concrete cutting and demolition works to allow the existing pavement to be cut and re-installed with new concrete to allow future tanker truck movements into the Newport Terminal. The WG subcontractor performed the appropriate underground surveys (ie wanding) and service locationreports including adial before you dig (DBYD) report suppliedby the Client. TheDBYD report had been interpreted at the time that the underground telecom cableleading to the redundant office building had beenidentified andpresumed to be dead. The WG subcontractor methodology to remove the cut concrete was to remove the cut section in panels. While lifting the concrete panels up out of the ground with an excavator the underlying telecom cable was severed in the process, due to the sharp concrete panel edge. The telecom cable was not encapsulatedin any physical protection (i.e. directly buried underneath the concrete). A risk assessment was completed and a valid permit was obtained for the task in close consultation with the Client.</td>\n",

He then immediately returned to the cylinder, isolated and disconnected the hose from the source (the hose was energized and then isolated within ~ 15 seconds – normal lighting of oxy propane torch would take ~ 5 seconds) The work party proceeded to remove the spare hose from the module as it was not required.

Nobody was injured during the incident, but the panel board interior was damaged. A permit was in place and the panel board was isolated and locked off to allow the work to be undertaken. On installing the RCD it was found that the neutral wire was too short. It was decided to terminate the wire in to an addition terminal block, and wire from the terminal block to the RCD. The additional terminal block (blue terminal block) was mounted on an existing DIN rail, adjacent to a grey terminal block designated L3, as seen on the attached photographs. The blue terminal block was installed in the wrong orientation, with it’s exposed terminals facing the exposed terminals of terminal block L3. Thus when the panel board was re-energised a short circuit occurred between the neutral circuit in the blue terminal block and the live circuit in the grey L3 terminal block. The exposed neutral terminals (blue terminal block) should have been facing away from the L3 live terminals. The panel board internal covers were re-installed and the panel board closed before the electrical isolation was removed and the panel board re-energised.</td>\n",

The decision was made to use a 12’x 4”x2” aluminum screed. The screed would be placed across the top of the tower section with the use of a 9’ level for visual verification. As a method of transporting the screed to the top of the tower mid-section, the worker used a three foot long tool lanyard, hooked to his side D-ring, and carried the screed up the ladder. The screed was hanging below and behind him as he ascended the ladder. During the climb, the lanyard lost grip and the screed slid out. This allowed the screed to fall toward the deck below. The involved worker was the only person on the ladder. A co-worker was standing on the deck below. The screed made contact with the structure and internal equipment during the drop and came to rest in an almost horizontal position as it approached the floor.  Incident rated Actual A1 as there were no injuries or damage to the tower. Rated Potential B5 as there was a risk of a worker below being struck resulting in serious (possible life threatening) injury.\\t\\t\\t</td>\n",

The seas made the vessel dip down into the valley of a swell but the operator kept hold of the tool bag. He lost his balance falling forward with his left shoulder striking a tire on the back of the vessel as he entered the water. The captain immediately went to idle on the engines and let the sea current separate the vessel from the operator and the boat dock. The operator wearing a PFD, floated away from the boat dock and motor vessel. Man overboard was sounded with two deckhands and another operator monitoring his position and preparing rescue equipment while the captain kept proper distance. After an adequate distance from the operator the captain repositioned the motor vessel and he was retrieved from the water using a life ring buoy attached to a rope. The operator climbed back up onto the motor vessel under his own power. The employee was brought back to the main facility and has returned to work. Actual severity of B1 is due to one person involved with the health effect of minor discomfort in his left shoulder. Potential severity of B3 is due to the possibility of a more serious injury causing a lost work case.Case reopened for upgrade from B1 to B2 Actual due to follow up evaluation and diagnostic testing identifying right shoulder labrum lesion and partial tear of the rotator cuff on 12/30/20 and confirmed by 1/8/21 Orthopedic Surgeon evaluation maintaining the same sedentary work restrictions and prescribing physical therapy.</td>\n",

While attempting to travel underneath the 7.2 kV powerline onto Bedford Road the excavator boom made contact with lower line. The spotter was on the right side of the excavator at the time of the incident and did not see the power line.  The actual rating of A1 was selected due to there being no injuries or asset damage as a result of the incident. The potential severity rating selected was a C5 as although no personnel were injured, it could have resulted in a serious injury to the operator and/or fatality to the spotter that was approximately 20’ from the excavator at the time of the incident.March 24, 2021 Update to Potential Severity - Full Details in L2 Report - This incident was originally classified by the project in CAIRS potential severity rating selected was a C5 as although no personnel were injured, the project belief is that it could have resulted in a serious injury to the operator and/or potential fatality to the spotter located approximately 20’ from the excavator at the time. It is unlikely that any injury would have taken place to the operator of the excavator or nearby personnel in the area, as the operator and spotter were aware of the overhead lines. For an injury to have taken place either the excavator boom knuckle would have needed to contact the upper line 7,200 volts at (4 feet above) or nearly touch to provide a pathway to ground personnel. The investigation team review determined that in this particular case the equipment boom height was such that it could only have struck the neutral wire and not reach the 7.2kV line. This is a mitigating factor and there was not a High Potential opportunity for multiple fatalities C5 or single fatality C4. The incident post ELT/IRP was reclassified for potential as A2 Moderate loss/ damage/ business impact (10-100K) as due to cost of the investigation and business impact at the project.

The crew used a rope and pulley system to lower the head of the counter-weighted mast to the ground where the work was performed (bulb change).  When complete, the crew began raising the mast by pulling on the rope and pulley system, to pull the base back down and raise the head. However as the base of the mast approached the closed position, the pulley has detached from the D-shackle securing it to the mast. This has resulted in the head of the mast returning to ground level where it has contacted a live pipe scratching the paintwork, and bending the upper section of the mast.  Preliminary inquiries indicate the pulley has seized during the movement resulting in the D-shackle twisting out of the pulley hook.  No persons were in the line of fire and no injuries sustained. Due to the counter-weight in the base of the mast balancing the head, there was no 'free-fall' event.</td>\n",

On closer inspection it was observed that one piece of insulation cladding, circa 75cm x 75cm and weighing 1.4kg, was found to be lying on an access platform, approximately half way up the Stabilisation Column, circa 2m from its original location.  A second, and larger piece of insulation cladding was found to be located on an access platform above Separation Train 2 Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) export pumps, approximately 3m above grade. This section measured circa 96cm x 215cm, weighing 6.5kg and is believed to have fallen circa 17m. The remaining cladding on the affected area of the Stabilisation Column was secured and made safe.

       "      <td>Executive Summary.  For full investigation report see attached:  As part of the inspection and test plan, the Senior Project Engineer (SPE) had required to check the Pumps 1 &amp; 2 expansion joint torque values on randomly picked bolts.  The expansion joints are located on three floors namely Floor C, E and F.  The torque values are checked using a battery operated torque wrench (RAD Gun).  Torque is applied through the socket assisted by a Reaction Arm which turns (at very low speed) until it engages with an adjacent nut and applies leverage force allowing the RAD Gun to operate.  The torque values had been up to 680 N·m.  The SPE had been provided tuition by the Leading Hand Mechanical Tradesman (MT) on the safe use of the RAD Gun which had included where to and not to place the hands, highlighting the Reaction Arm as a place not to put your hands when in operation.  The SPE had safely checked the torque values on up to 20 bolts before moving on to F Floor to complete the same checks.  Late morning the SPE had proceeded to F Floor to carry out the bolt torque value checks on Pumps 1 &amp; 2 expansion joints.  The MT and Project Supervisor were on F Floor at the time.  The SPE had checked 3-4 bolts on the upper side of the expansion joint on Pump 1 before proceeding to the lower side of the joint.  The SPE had gotten down on his knees and placed the Rad Gun socket over a nut (65mm).  As the socket was not engaged properly, the SPE reversed the socket a little until fully engaged on the nut.  The SPE had then proceeded to torque the nut without realising his hand had been on the RAD Guns Reaction Arm.  As the Reaction Arm engaged on the adjacent nut, the skin on the palm of the SPE’s right hand had got caught between the Reaction Arm and the nut resulting in a skin laceration.  The SPE had then pulled his hand away and sought assistance from the PS and MT.</td>\n",

A plume of lime powder blew out of the line and contacted I/E's face and neck.  A severity of B1 was selected as there was one individual requiring First Aid. A potential severity of C2 was selected due to the potential for Hydrated Lime exposure to require further medical treatment, and the potential for a second employee who was operating the vac truck controls about 6 feet away to have been exposed.</td>\n",
