Encoding. The various steps of the pipeline are:\n","\n","- The Normalizer: in charge of normalizing the text. Common examples of normalization are the unicode normalization standards, such as NFD or NFKC.\n","- The PreTokenizer: in charge of creating initial words splits in the text. The most common way of splitting text is simply on whitespace.\n","- The Model: in charge of doing the actual tokenization. An example of a Model would be BPE or WordPiece.\n","- The PostProcessor: in charge of post-processing the Encoding to add anything relevant that, for example, a language model would need, such as special tokens.\n","```\n","\n","We will be using the GPT-2 tokenizer to tokenize our flavor text data. The defaults of this function set the bos (beginning of sentence) eos (end of sentence) to '<|endoftext|>' but we can specifically set them differently to differentiate and also assign a non-default pad token that will take care of white space for differently sized text.
