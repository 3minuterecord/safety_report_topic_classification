at law twelve working his way back to law one as the operator returned the chain on law eight to its stopper a hydraulic hose hum426 supplying the traveling latch closest to the operators control panel failed allowing the release of hydraulic oil on to the main deckthe operator was protected from the release of the escaping oil due to the location of the operators control panel and the surrounding structure of the law following the initial release of pressure from the hydraulic hose the mcro was able to isolate the hose via the hydraulic supply valve preventing further release of hydraulic oil following the release the mcro checked to ensure that the deck scupper plugs were in place to prevent any of the oil entering the sea the mcro then began to soak up the released oil utilising absorbent pads the handle to the hydraulic supply valve was removed to prevent accidental opening of the supply valve and barriers put in place to restrict the access to law eight a bucket
