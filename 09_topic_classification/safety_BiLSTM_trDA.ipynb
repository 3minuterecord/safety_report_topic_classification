at eight hundred and forty-five am the general foreman and the two riggers escorted the crane up to olefins one the initial configuration had the flatbed facing the crane to the north while the crane faced back to the south this was the plan decided by the general foreman which would allow the crane to pick the pipe and set in down in the proper orientation for installation along the western edge of the road the general foreman then left to check on other crews at nine hundred and eleven the riggers took their brake while the riggers were on brake the crane operator decided he did not like the fact that the truck would be facing him while it would be offloaded so he decided to turn the truck and back it in because it would allow for the center of the pipe to be closer to the crane this would throw off the orientation of the pipe after brake both riggers explained to the operator that they did not agree with this change to the plan the crane operator said he had the final say on the lift and this is how he was going to make the pick while they did not agree with him they changed configuration of the rigging to try to make it work the crane operator made the decision to pick the pipe without extending and using his outriggers neither rigger felt comfortable with this but the operator explained that he was good for ten thousand pounds to the front on his tires and the load weighed less than five hundred pounds there was a team inc xray truck positioned to the southeast of the flatbed one of the riggers knocked on the door and explained to the team crew what they were about to do the riggers thought the team truck would move but they just went back to work instead the rigger who was flagging had the operator cable up on the load and swing it four feet to the west crane was facing south this allowed the truck driver to pull the truck to the south away from the task as the operator was cabling down two pipe foremen approached and said the pipe needed to be spun around in the orientation it would need to be installed the rigger flagging the crane said they would do that later but the operator insisted that they would do it at that moment the flagger spun the pipe back toward the east while it was spinning the second rigger was positioned near the team inc xray truck while the pipe came close to the truck approximately one thousand, two hundred and

line that is abandoned and repair may not be needed the potential severity rating is a a1 since if unmarked telephone line is corroborated as to be in service estimated repair cost will be minimal work was stopped jsa was closed verizon and utility quest were called to notify them about the unmarked line they showed up next day and were able to corroborate that the unmarked telephone line was abandoned and was cut at the box they did discover a total of five telephone lines coming out of the box including the unmarked that was contacted and the one shown on the one call report plot plan

of the wg employee was to monitor a third party construction team 3s in setting up to install a new valve on a gun barrel tank the original plan agreed between the two parties onsite was to cut out a piece of pipe from an overhead line we believe connecting two tanks one being the gun barrel tank and the second being a brand new tank the construction team goal was to install a new valve in the

as the operator returned the chain on law eight to its stopper a hydraulic hose hum426 supplying the traveling latch closest to the operators control panel failed allowing the release of hydraulic oil on to the main deck the operator was protected from the release of the escaping oil due to the location of the operators control panel and the surrounding structure of the law following the initial release of pressure from the hydraulic hose the mcro was able to isolate the hose via the hydraulic supply valve preventing further release of hydraulic oil following the release the mcro checked to ensure that the deck scupper plugs were in place to prevent any of the oil entering the sea the mcro then began to soak up the released oil utilising absorbent pads the handle to the hydraulic supply
