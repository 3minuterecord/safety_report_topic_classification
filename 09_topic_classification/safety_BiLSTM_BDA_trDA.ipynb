pilot drill bit from the tool and that usually the hole cutter would retain the slug within itself is this a feature of the tool i e is that what it is designed to do retain the slug or is this simply a fortunate outcome nine times out of ten it was the centre dab of the rota broach bit itself that was removed which is not in itself unusual and does not alter the cutting ability of the rota broach

to identify any similar gaskets that had been purchased and placed into service in three hundred systems following indepth discussions with klinger the gasket manufacturer a decision was reached that

further torque was then applied to the test joint in an attempt to reach the torque value required for a spiral wound gasket 186nm the test gasket was crushed before reaching the target torque value of 186nm when the maximum compressive strength of the gasket was exceeded the circumference growth of the gasket was such that the gasket was in contact with all four bolt sleeves and the gasket had crackedthe testing was completed in a controlled environment test bay with little or no background noise because of this the gasket failure was easily seenheard and felt by the torque engineer however the investigation team were of the opinion that an individual fitting the same type gasket in an offshore environment may not have seenheard nor felt the gasket failing while they were applying

all aspects of the incident which would ensure that lessons were jointly learned and implemented the tors were modified after an initial visit on site to consider wgis aspects only following a meeting with h w twenty march eighteen wgis were invited to review the electrical arrangements at fs2 specifically the welding electrical arrangements to and within the habitats there were no immediately obvious root causes that would explain the electric shocks which the ips had received a specialist electrical engineer see was contacted by wgis to attended site and assess report on the electrical installation and potential sources of electrical shock discharge the see met with the h w electrical team facilities manager which was followedup by a walk round of the incident site electrical set up a draft report has subsequently been issued for review following the visit a final report is anticipated on twenty-eight march eighteen the report initial feedback concludes that there are no obvious electrical deficiencies which would lead to an electrical shock discharge that were observed on the day of the walkround it was not clear at the time if the electrical setup had been modified or changed between walk round and the site incident subsequent to the incident the wgis safe systems of works were checked by the wgis she manager and all required documentation and briefing were found to be in order summary of investigationfindings1 the immediate because was as follows electrical shock two the root because was as follows exposure to significant electrical current the source of the electrical shock discharge has not been identified three the immediate actions taken were all welding works were suspended across the site an immediate site investigation carried out by h w assisted by two external 3rd parties the investigation involved a review of the weld electrical arrangements at fs2 note the arrangements at each habitat are similar in installation and setup all scaffold works were stopped on habitats adjacent to ongoing welding works until confirmation of the suitability of the electrical installation or any remediation actions were undertaken to prevent a possible
