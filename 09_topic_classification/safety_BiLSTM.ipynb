their was significant background noise in this area from two alpha fans on interview the topman lowering the scaffold tube confirmed he had lost control of the hand line during the final descent of the tube to the dockside a distance estimated to be up to 10m the line had been looped over the top handrail to act as break but is dependent on the operative controllingthe line the scaffold tube

plastic welded to the tanks double inner and outer tank wallsthe plastic pipe external wall weld point was identified at the dosing system design phase as a weak point and the risk of shearing from

risk of shearing from applied lateral forces on the plastic pipe was not identified and no protective measures were installedthe piping was not designed to transfer any load to the tank and therefore it was not subject to piping stress analysis calculations access to the tank was considered during the design however the fill line for the tank is located on the weather deck located above the storage tanks location in the utilities area so no access is required at the tank itself for normal chemical handling operations as a result access to and around the tank was considered to be infrequent once the new chemical dosing system design was confirmed wgpsn subcontracted the supply of the tanks and pipework to pipex who fabricated the system materials in compliance with chemical industry standardsincident as part of the final system commissioning process rope access riggers were employed to remove goc isolation tags from chemical dosing pipework located above the sodium hypochlorite storage tank at approximately 4pm on 3rd june two thousand and sixteen one of the riggers descended to floor level next to the tank on walking away from the tank the rigger failed to notice that one of the wire slings attached to his person entangled on the outlet valve of the tank causing a momentary snatch loading onto the pipework as the lanyard became taught the force of the snatch loading caused the tank outlet plastic pipe to shear at the outlet nozzle n2 which in turn allowed approximately 800kgs of sodium hypochlorite to release from the tank onto the deck which was subsequently washed with firewater via the platform drain system to sea no injuries were sustained a pon1 was submitted calculations from wgpsn have confirmed that the snatch loading force of a person

result of reduced flow of lube oil so the lube oil system was inspected it was found that the differential pressure across the filter was at around ten psi twice it is normal pressure indicating that the filter was suffering from a higher than normal resistance so was partially blocked mechanical technicians replaced the filters and the lube pump was run for several hours and remained at less than five psi indicating that the lube oil system was circulating properlyon the next start on 19th june all indicated faults had been reset so no dormant fault remained on the system however soon after start up the temperature indications at the motor and generator drive end and nondrive end bearings were observed to be creeping up towards their alarm and trip points these temperatures were higher than would be expected under normal conditions so the ipp was shut down in a controlled manner on further investigation of the lube oil cooling system it was found that cooling water was not being circulated due to a closed control valvethe impulse line to the pressure transmitter on the control loop was flushed through and the system was function tested and it was found that the valve responded correctly it is likely that either an airlock or debris ingress to the impulse line had partially blocked it after a period of three hours the lube oil cooling system was found to be stable the ipp was then started up and system parameters monitoredthe causes for the ipp trip was a combination of lube oil filters reduced flow and lube oil cooling water flow control valve closed see

arrived at the turbine the electrical technician immediately went to fetch a fire extinguisher from the nearest fire point the decision was made to open the turbine enclosure door and extinguish the fire using a co2 extinguisher as the fixed fire system had not activatedonce the fire had been extinguished the enclose door was closed and the turbine enclosure was monitored from the observation windowfurther temperature checks were made utilising a thermal camera where the temperature was noted to be dropping in the area where the fire occurred the area was monitored for approximately one hour after which the enclosure doors were opened to aid further cooling and to carry out an inspection of the area where the fire had occurredit was noted that the turbine fixed fire system did not

the hp flare meter by installing the newer fgm one hundred and sixty previously fgm one hundred and thirty technology as advised by the manufacturer the aim of which was to improve the reliability of current readings the scope was to install a new hp flare meter in the field in place of obsolete equipment direct replacement with same tag numbers and reconfigure the cable infrastructure to maintain signal integrityduring installation problems were encountered with the power supply the cable installed was too long which resulted in insufficient power to the meter attempts were made to utilise the existing power cable and also to attempt to reinstate the old flare meter however both attempts proved unsuccessful a notification was submitted to the environment agency on the 24th september to make them aware of the situation on 26th september functionality was reestablished and the contracting engineer configured the new meter following this the hp flare meter became operational again by one thousand, four hundred on the 27th september this is a temporary measure until a field power supply can be installed due to lead times design checks and moc processes this is anticipated as being late

noncompliant with the monitoring and reporting regulation mrr of the cats euets permit the environment agency was notified without delay please refer to attached notification and response from the environment agencysequence of eventsit was identified in summer two thousand and thirteen that although the flare gas metering systems were working correctly they were twenty years old and many of the operating components were now or becoming obsolete this presented concerns regarding future reliability of the system a project was set up in two thousand and fourteen to look at other suppliers to manage this potential failure however the project was put on hold in november 2014in december two thousand and fourteen the lp system failed cats technicians cleaned and replaced the probes but this did not fix the issue abel fluenta engineers were then brought in to investigate the fault it was found that a failed lp electronics board in the fgm130 flow computer was the source of this issue this resulted in data loss of a month until the start of january two thousand and fifteen when a replacement fgm160 field flow computer was installed and commissioned kelton were then brought in to do an uncertainty report on both the hp and lp flare metersas the hp used the same system as the lp flare it was predicted that the same failure could be expected the original date for the hp flare meter replacement was planned for october two thousand and fifteen however due to taspas issues this was delayed as further design was required at the start of two thousand and sixteen the replacement field flow computer for the hp flare additional junction box was installed and cables moved added to facilitate a quick cut over to the new hp flare meter due to workloads the upgrade was not carried out in q2 two thousand and sixteen and q3 was also not possible due to the tar a decision was made by the cats leadership team to defer until q3 two thousand and sixteen the hp flare meter failed on the 23rd september which meant that there were no meter readings for five days this resulted in a noncompliance with the euets permit which could have led to a financial penalty and potential reputational damage from the environment agency noncompliances are made publically available as the permit is in the name of cats north sea limited any fines would have been on the clientimmediate causes failed power supply to the hp flare meterroot system causes age of the flare metering system twenty years old and obsolete equipment leading to a decrease in reliability meant that an upgrade was requiredrecommendations to prevent system recurrenceas both flare metering systems have been upgraded and there are additional improvements being implemented to the system eg it is considered that the risk of recurrence is extremely low however there are other combustion sources on the euets permit which require continued management it is acknowledged that the hp flare meter upgrade project was deferred on several occasions and that a commitment had been made to the environment agency by the previous operator to complete this upgrade in two thousand and fifteen it is possible that the environment agency could have responded differently leaving cnsl and wood group exposed to financial and reputational impact given that wood group do not own the euets permit but manage it as part of our role of operating partner it is highly recommended that going forward any potential issues which can have an impact on compliance with the permit are escalated to the correct level and captured on

bridges arches at gilligan st and the fapsnavy st entrance had been removed previously in addition to allowing vehicles to drive underneath it is surmised the arches also prevented the horizontal lengths of pipe from rotating from pipe demolition performed up to this point removal of the arches at both ends of the faps pipe corridor both ends effectively unrestrained the six hundred feet of pipe remaining in between the arches movement of the pipes during demolition in other areas had been previously observed therefore attempts to restrain the pipe using chain binders and welding were made but proved to be insufficient the deteriorated condition of the pipe support rack and associated anchors severe corrosion ultimately lead to the entire pipe support system being compromised to varying degreesthe morning of nineteen april scheduled predemolition activities took place consisting of removing sections of chain link fencing conduits and smallbore pipes laying down plastic tarps to catch paint chips etc in the afternoon pipe demo operations recommencedpipe demo operations are conducted by heavy equipment utilizing two excavators cutting up the pipe into twenty foot sections for transportrecycling one excavator is equipped with a grapple and the other with a hydraulic shear the grapple grips the pipe about ten feet from the end of the pipe midway between the end and the shear point while the grapple holds the pipe in place the shear will cut the pipe the grapple will then remove the cut section of pipe which is placed into a rolloff containerin the afternoon while shearing sections of the upper pipe runs a piece of metal from the cut end of the pipe remaining in place got stuck in the shear not allowing the shear to completely release while trying to free the shear the weight of the pipe shifted note the shear operator stated he made no back and forth movement of the equipment or shear attachment as this would result in significant movement of the pipe remaining on the rack only a cwccw rotation of the shear attachment was used but some movement of the pipe was unavoidable this movement placed added pressure to faps side of the tshaped pipe support it is hypothesized the weight shift caused the anchor bolts on the next pipe support down the line to fail due to moderate to severe corrosion to the embedded anchor plate andor anchor bolts the failure of the initial pipe supportanchor continued to transfer stresses down the line causing each pipe support to topple in turn domino effect eventually allowing approximately six hundred lf of the upper pipes to roll off the pipe support as anchor bolts continued to break and the pipe support were bent over the felling of upper pipes occurred over a six hundred and ten second period as the remaining pipe support system was compromised by the chain reactionit should be noted that the dropped object potential from pipe demolition operations has always been recognized and anticipated such that no personnel are ever permitted near piping being demolished while the applicable tra task risk assessment does not specifically mention the faps pipe rack hazards associated with demolition including from shearing and the potential for falling andor shifting objects are clearly identified to account for this recognized hazard strict are controls were established and adhered to whereby personnel are not permitted within or adjacent to the work zone established for demolition operations all faps operations were immediately halted and all personnel accounted for the scene was secured and documented assessments were then made to determine the stability of the toppled pipes and resulting damage if any fencing at the south end of the faps pipe corridor where the remaining vertical piping at the gilligan st pipe bridgearch was observed to have sustained some damage the hydraulic shear was repositioned and short lengths of piping was carefully cut and removed using only heavy
