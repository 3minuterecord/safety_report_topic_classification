and concerns the job was stopped and a time out for safety was called with all four team members to highlight the seriousness of this high potential incident and to remind them about the risk of being removed from the facility as per a previous incident that occurred with a subcontractor a follow up safety stand down was called and the incident was discussed with the oim maintenance supervisors safety officer and the team members based on the employee statement he decided to climb up to remove the shackle as part of housekeeping the employee chose not to wear his fall protection as it would have taken longer to reach up to the slings and connect his fall arrestor than it would to climb up and remove the shackle without protection the initial investigation revealed that a safety harness was on site and 2x slings secured to the structure for connecting the fall arrestor this indicated the need for increasing awareness and need for using fall protection 03feb2018detailed investigation

been considered and will be discussed with the employee by the incountry hexagon operations manager prior to the employee returning offshore 13feb2018 during the investigation is was identified that the onsite supervisor lead mechanic did instruct the employee to remove the lifting and hoisting equipment as per the agreed plan which included wearing the detailed working at height fall arrest equipment however at the time of the incident the onsite supervisor did not witness the employee violating the working at height procedure it was in fact the passing maintenance supervisor who witnesses the employee working at height without the required fall protection thus leading to the decision that the lead mechanic does not require formal disciplinary action the lead mechanic was involved in the time out for safety and the investigation process 13feb2018additional information received from the fpso maintenance supervisor the roll out table was still in progress of being

tiong woon construction was setting up a 50ton crane hired from hua tiong cranes to install the gtg cooler unit at cogen one after rerigging the crane block the crane operator was given instruction to raise the boom to sixty-five and to extend the boom to 20meters as per instruction the operator raised the boom and extended the boom to take the tension in the wire rope but it was noted that the main block remained stationary i e did not equalize the tension across the falls the crane operator then attempted the action for a second time to no avail but despite releasing the hoisting cable the block was not coming down he immediately stopped operation it is thought at some point during the operation the crane operator had winched down quickly causing an entanglementthe operator alighted from the crane cabin to discuss the problem with the lifting supervisor it was at this time during the discussion that the main block free fell about two meters before stopping about five meters above the ground immediately the whole operation was stopped there was no load or rigging equipment connected to the main block and no personnel were directly below the hook nor the crane boom and there was no injury reported the plan was to install gtg cooler and starter motor at cogen one using a fifty ton crane the weight of the equipment is six 2tons as per drawing and the total weight inclusive of rigging accessories the main block and a ten percent contingency the planned lift would be seven 17tons it was noted by the investigation team that as no gtg equipment or rigging had been connected the dead weight on the line was only the weight of the crane block of 250kg as the block was considered a dead weight and the crane was not in operation it is believed that there was no potential for the crane block which hung naturally to swing the crane in use at the time of the incident was a demag ac five hundred and one rough terrain crane 50ton was a hired by tiong woon construction from hua tiong cranes for the activity it had been inspected and carried the appropriate inspection sticker for the project it was highlighted during the investigation that when the crane was supplied it came with a different configuration which was incorrect for the planned job i e the supplied configuration was for a capacity lower than planned and the crane needed to be reconfigured to suit the lifting plan it was found that the configuration came with a two part line configuration which was regarded as normal for daily operations but needed to be increased to a three part line configuration the reconfiguration was conducted on site as would be expected as it is not considered difficult but must be undertaken by competent persons the lifting crew consisted of the lifting supervisor three riggersignalmen the crane operator a safety coordination and the overall lead for the gtg cooler installation evening of 18th july two thousand and sixteen before leaving the site the lifting supervisor with seven years active experience in lifting went through the following days activities and noticed one of the activity was to install the gtg cooler when he went through the lifting plan he realized that the crane part line has to be increased to three part lines from the existing two part lines about 630pm he informed the crane operator to inform hua tiong operations to get it change by 900am on 19th july two thousand and sixteen the crane operator replied that he will try as this was very short notice in the morning of the 19th july two thousand and sixteen after collecting the ptws and crane lifting checklist the lifting supervisor conducted the ptt and waited for hua tiong crew to change the part line the lifting supervisor asked the crane operator why hua tiong crew was not on site and was told that the crew is busy at another location as the instruction to reconfigure the part lines was given at short notice and thus the crew was committed elsewhere as time passed the lifting supervisor grew impatient and realised the crew will not be there soon and the lifting had to be carried out in the morning he told the crane operator that he will change the part line as he had been trained and qualified by twc and done this before on numerous occasions on twc cranes he proceeded to gather his lifting crew to carry out the change and the crane operator agreed and did not challenge the decision the ptw was in place but did not consider changing reconfiguration and there was no method statement nor job safety analysis jsa it was also evident that when the decision was taken to proceed with the reconfiguration no ptt was conducted specifically for this task i e as the task to change the part lines on the crane is considered a change in work not planned a ptt should have been redone with the persons involved it was noted by the investigation team that crane wire reconfiguration is not a course offered by the ministry of manpower and there is no register i e individuals are required to attend inhouse training and be appointed as a competent person crane erection e g for lattice boom cranes is different where individuals and companies are required to be registered with the ministry of manpower having said this there is a liability question as to apportioning responsibility for the crane re configuration i e a mechanical contractor changing the configuration of another company equipment without any agreements being place it should be highlighted that the question as to the agreement between companies to reconfigure could not be verified as there is no documentation to support or refute either companies claims the lifting supervisor was trained and qualified by twc he had carried out similar task on numerous occasions on twc cranes at various sites but first time in cogen project and another crane provider crane the crane operator was instructed to lower the crane boom and slacken the wire rope from the winch drum which was done the main block safety device was removed and the wire rope was detached from the termination point at the boom head and put through the additional sheave and reterminated the wire rope after this the crane operator was instructed to wind back the slacken wire rope was done and reinstated the safety device the operator was told by the lifting supervisor to check the condition of the wire rope on the winch drum according to the crane operator this was not possible as the winch drum is positioned at higher elevation of the crane to access that location it will require working at height equipment which were not made available however the crane operator glanced to the rear to check winch drum and told the lifting supervisor everything is in order everyone cleared from the barricaded area as the task was considered as being completed thereafter the lifting supervisor instructed the riggersignalman to raise the crane and to extend the crane boom the crane operator executed the maneuvers without realizing the wire rope got entangled causing the main block to free fall them and amecfw personnel whom were standing outside the barricaded area immediately instructed the lifting supervisor to stop the activity hua tiong crane crew were immediately summoned to the location to assess the situation after studying the situation it was made known that the wire rope was slack on the winch drum hua tiong supervisor instructed crane operator to extend the boom to clear the entanglement when entanglement was cleared the crane was safely closed down and then removed from site for the lifting of gtg cooler and starter motor there was a valid crane lifting checklist there was an approved lifting plan and this task was discussed in the ptt even though three part lines are required for the lifting operation there was no consultation with amecfw lifting specialist pertaining to changing of part lines normally crane mobilization demobilization checklist would cover such activity however in this case the checklist was not used because the crane had already been mobilized on the previous day summaryin summary the investigation has highlighted the following critical points one hiap seng lifting supervisor issued an instruction to reconfigure the crane block but the instruction came late when the crane was not reconfigured in the morning and the hua tiong crew did not show up he became impatient and proceeded to make the adjustment he was trained in house by twc to make the change for twc cranes two no permit to work jsa or ptt was in place for the task3 it is believed that the crane operator may have operated the crane too quickly i e did not set the speed limiter for the number of parts on the crane block in doing so it is possible that the crane drum to quickly for the crane block resulting in a slight entanglement four the crane operator did not check the component parts adequately following the change because there was no ppe harness available on site one stand down was conducted for the lifting crew and crane operator on nineteen jul twenty thousand, one hundred and sixty-two crane made safe demobilized from sjcp project along with crane

safety stand down was called and the incident was discussed with the oim maintenance supervisors safety officer and the team members based on the employee statement he decided to climb up to remove the shackle as part of housekeeping the employee chose not to wear his fall protection as it would have taken longer to reach up to the slings and connect his fall arrestor than it would to climb up

at some point during the operation the crane operator had winched down quickly causing an entanglementthe operator alighted from the crane cabin to discuss the problem with the lifting supervisor it

not considered difficult but must be undertaken by competent persons the lifting crew consisted of the lifting supervisor three riggersignalmen the crane operator a safety coordination and the overall lead for the gtg cooler installation evening of 18th july two thousand and sixteen before leaving the site the lifting supervisor with seven years active experience in lifting went through the following days activities and noticed one of the activity was to install the gtg cooler when he went through the lifting plan he realized that the crane part line has to be increased to three part lines from the existing two part lines about 630pm he informed the crane operator to inform hua tiong operations to get it change by 900am on 19th july two thousand and sixteen the crane operator replied that he will try as this was very short notice in the morning of the 19th july two thousand and sixteen after collecting the ptws and crane lifting checklist the lifting supervisor conducted the ptt and waited for hua tiong crew to change the part line the lifting supervisor asked the crane operator why hua tiong crew was not on site and was told that the crew is busy at another location as the instruction to reconfigure the part lines was given at short notice and thus the crew was committed elsewhere as time passed the lifting supervisor grew impatient and realised the crew will not be there soon and the lifting had to be carried out in the morning he told the crane operator that he will change the part line as he had been trained and qualified by twc and done this before on numerous occasions on twc cranes he proceeded to gather his lifting crew to carry out the change and the crane operator agreed and did not challenge the decision the ptw was in place but did not consider changing reconfiguration and there was no method statement nor job safety analysis jsa it was also evident that when the decision was taken to proceed with the reconfiguration no ptt was conducted specifically for this task i e as the task to change the part lines on the crane is considered a change in work not planned a ptt should have been redone with the persons involved it was noted by the investigation team that crane wire reconfiguration is not a course offered by the ministry of manpower and there is no register i e individuals are required to attend inhouse training and be appointed as a competent person crane erection e g for lattice boom cranes is different where individuals and companies are required to be registered with the ministry of manpower having said this there is a liability question as to apportioning responsibility for the crane re configuration i e a mechanical contractor changing the configuration of another company equipment without any agreements being place it should be highlighted that the question as to the agreement between companies to reconfigure could not be verified as there is no documentation to support or refute either companies claims the lifting supervisor was trained and qualified by twc he had carried out similar task on numerous occasions on twc cranes at various sites but first time in cogen project and another crane provider crane the crane operator was instructed to lower the crane boom and slacken the wire rope from the winch drum which was done the main block safety device was removed and the wire rope was detached from the termination point at the boom head and put through the additional sheave and reterminated the wire rope after this the crane operator was instructed to wind back the slacken wire rope was done and reinstated the safety device the operator was told by the lifting supervisor to check the condition of the wire rope on the winch drum according to the crane operator this was not possible as the winch drum is positioned at higher elevation of the crane to access that location it will require working at height equipment which were not made available however the crane operator glanced to the rear to check winch drum and told the lifting supervisor everything is in order everyone cleared from the barricaded area as the task was considered as being completed thereafter the lifting supervisor instructed the riggersignalman to raise the crane and to extend the crane boom the crane operator executed the maneuvers without realizing the wire rope got entangled causing the main block to free fall them and amecfw personnel whom were standing outside the barricaded area immediately instructed the lifting supervisor to stop the activity hua tiong crane crew were immediately summoned to the location to assess the situation after studying the situation it was made known that the wire rope was slack on the winch drum hua tiong supervisor instructed crane operator to extend the boom to clear the entanglement when entanglement was cleared the crane was safely closed down and then removed from site for the lifting of gtg cooler and starter motor there was a valid crane lifting checklist there was an approved lifting plan and this task was discussed in the ptt even though three part lines are required for the lifting operation there was no consultation with amecfw lifting specialist pertaining to changing of part lines normally crane mobilization demobilization checklist would cover such activity however in this case the checklist was not used because the crane had already been mobilized on the previous day summaryin summary the investigation has highlighted the following critical points one hiap seng lifting supervisor issued an instruction to reconfigure the crane block but the instruction came late when the crane was not reconfigured in the morning and the hua tiong crew did not show up he became impatient and proceeded to make the adjustment he was trained in house by twc to make the change for twc cranes two no permit to work jsa or ptt was in place for the task3 it is believed that the crane operator may have operated the crane too quickly i e did not set the speed limiter for the number of parts on the crane block in doing so it is possible that the crane drum to quickly for the crane block resulting in a slight entanglement four the crane operator did not check the component parts adequately following the change because there was no ppe harness available on site one stand down was conducted for the lifting crew and crane operator on nineteen jul twenty thousand, one hundred and sixty-two crane made safe demobilized from sjcp project along with crane operator on nineteen jul two thousand and

plastic welded to the tanks double inner and outer tank wallsthe plastic pipe external wall weld point was identified at the dosing system design phase as a weak point and the risk of shearing from

risk of shearing from applied lateral forces on the plastic pipe was not identified and no protective measures were installedthe piping was not designed to transfer any load to the tank and therefore it was not subject to piping stress analysis calculations access to the tank was considered during the design however the fill line for the tank is located on the weather deck located above the storage tanks location in the utilities area so no access is required at the tank itself for normal chemical handling operations as a result access to and around the tank was considered to be infrequent once the new chemical dosing system design was confirmed wgpsn subcontracted the supply of the tanks and pipework to pipex who fabricated the system materials in compliance with chemical industry standardsincident as part of the final system commissioning process rope access riggers were employed to remove goc isolation tags from chemical dosing pipework located above the sodium hypochlorite storage tank at approximately 4pm on 3rd june two thousand and sixteen one of the riggers descended to floor level next to the tank on walking away from the tank the rigger failed to notice that one of the wire slings attached to his person entangled on the outlet valve of the tank causing a momentary snatch loading onto the pipework as the lanyard became taught the force of the snatch loading caused the tank outlet plastic pipe to shear at the outlet nozzle n2 which in turn allowed approximately 800kgs of sodium hypochlorite to release from the tank onto the deck which was subsequently washed with firewater via the platform drain system to sea no injuries were sustained a pon1 was submitted calculations from wgpsn have confirmed that the snatch loading force of a person

result of reduced flow of lube oil so the lube oil system was inspected it was found that the differential pressure across the filter was at around ten psi twice it is normal pressure indicating that the filter was suffering from a higher than normal resistance so was partially blocked mechanical technicians replaced the filters and the lube pump was run for several hours and remained at less than five psi indicating that the lube oil system was circulating properlyon the next start on 19th june all indicated faults had been reset so no dormant fault remained on the system however soon after start up the temperature indications at the motor and generator drive end and nondrive end bearings were observed to be creeping up towards their alarm and trip points these temperatures were higher than would be expected under normal conditions so the ipp was shut down in a controlled manner on further investigation of the lube oil cooling system it was found that cooling water was not being circulated due to a closed control valvethe impulse line to the pressure transmitter on the control loop was flushed through and the system was function tested and it was found that the valve responded correctly it is likely that either an airlock or debris ingress to the impulse line had partially blocked it after a period of three hours the lube oil cooling system was found to be stable the ipp was then started up and system parameters monitoredthe causes for the ipp trip was a combination of lube oil filters reduced flow and lube oil cooling water flow control valve closed see

arrived at the turbine the electrical technician immediately went to fetch a fire extinguisher from the nearest fire point the decision was made to open the turbine enclosure door and extinguish the fire using a co2 extinguisher as the fixed fire system had not activatedonce the fire had been extinguished the enclose door was closed and the turbine enclosure was monitored from the observation windowfurther temperature checks were made utilising a thermal camera where the temperature was noted to be dropping in the area where the fire occurred the area was monitored for approximately one hour after which the enclosure doors were opened to aid further cooling and to carry out an inspection of the area where the fire had occurredit was noted that the turbine fixed fire system did not

the hp flare meter by installing the newer fgm one hundred and sixty previously fgm one hundred and thirty technology as advised by the manufacturer the aim of which was to improve the reliability of current readings the scope was to install a new hp flare meter in the field in place of obsolete equipment direct replacement with same tag numbers and reconfigure the cable infrastructure to maintain signal integrityduring installation problems were encountered with the power supply the cable installed was too long which resulted in insufficient power to the meter attempts were made to utilise the existing power cable and also to attempt to reinstate the old flare meter however both attempts proved unsuccessful a notification was submitted to the environment agency on the 24th september to make them aware of the situation on 26th september functionality was reestablished and the contracting engineer configured the new meter following this the hp flare meter became operational again by one thousand, four hundred on the 27th september this is a temporary measure until a field power supply can be installed due to lead times design checks and moc processes this is anticipated as being late

noncompliant with the monitoring and reporting regulation mrr of the cats euets permit the environment agency was notified without delay please refer to attached notification and response from the environment agencysequence of eventsit was identified in summer two thousand and thirteen that although the flare gas metering systems were working correctly they were twenty years old and many of the operating components were now or becoming obsolete this presented concerns regarding future reliability of the system a project was set up in two thousand and fourteen to look at other suppliers to manage this potential failure however the project was put on hold in november 2014in december two thousand and fourteen the lp system failed cats technicians cleaned and replaced the probes but this did not fix the issue abel fluenta engineers were then brought in to investigate the fault it was found that a failed lp electronics board in the fgm130 flow computer was the source of this issue this resulted in data loss of a month until the start of january two thousand and fifteen when a replacement fgm160 field flow computer was installed and commissioned kelton were then brought in to do an uncertainty report on both the hp and lp flare metersas the hp used the same system as the lp flare it was predicted that the same failure could be expected the original date for the hp flare meter replacement was planned for october two thousand and fifteen however due to taspas issues this was delayed as further design was required at the start of two thousand and sixteen the replacement field flow computer for the hp flare additional junction box was installed and cables moved added to facilitate a quick cut over to the new hp flare meter due to workloads the upgrade was not carried out in q2 two thousand and sixteen and q3 was also not possible due to the tar a decision was made by the cats leadership team to defer until q3 two thousand and sixteen the hp flare meter failed on the 23rd september which meant that there were no meter readings for five days this resulted in a noncompliance with the euets permit which could have led to a financial penalty and potential reputational damage from the environment agency noncompliances are made publically available as the permit is in the name of cats north sea limited any fines would have been on the clientimmediate causes failed power supply to the hp flare meterroot system causes age of the flare metering system twenty years old and obsolete equipment leading to a decrease in reliability meant that an upgrade was requiredrecommendations to prevent system recurrenceas both flare metering systems have been upgraded and there are additional improvements being implemented to the system eg it is considered that the risk of recurrence is extremely low however there are other combustion sources on the euets permit which require continued management it is acknowledged that the hp flare meter upgrade project was deferred on several occasions and that a commitment had been made to the environment agency by the previous operator to complete this upgrade in two thousand and fifteen it is possible that the environment agency could have responded differently leaving cnsl and wood group exposed to financial and reputational impact given that wood group do not own the euets permit but manage it as part of our role of operating partner it is highly recommended that going forward any potential issues which can have an impact on compliance with the permit are escalated to the correct level and captured on

bridges arches at gilligan st and the fapsnavy st entrance had been removed previously in addition to allowing vehicles to drive underneath it is surmised the arches also prevented the horizontal lengths of pipe from rotating from pipe demolition performed up to this point removal of the arches at both ends of the faps pipe corridor both ends effectively unrestrained the six hundred feet of pipe remaining in between the arches movement of the pipes during demolition in other areas had been previously observed therefore attempts to restrain the pipe using chain binders and welding were made but proved to be insufficient the deteriorated condition of the pipe support rack and associated anchors severe corrosion ultimately lead to the entire pipe support system being compromised to varying degreesthe morning of nineteen april scheduled predemolition activities took place consisting of removing sections of chain link fencing conduits and smallbore pipes laying down plastic tarps to catch paint chips etc in the afternoon pipe demo operations recommencedpipe demo operations are conducted by heavy equipment utilizing two excavators cutting up the pipe into twenty foot sections for transportrecycling one excavator is equipped with a grapple and the other with a hydraulic shear the grapple grips the pipe about ten feet from the end of the pipe midway between the end and the shear point while the grapple holds the pipe in place the shear will cut the pipe the grapple will then remove the cut section of pipe which is placed into a rolloff containerin the afternoon while shearing sections of the upper pipe runs a piece of metal from the cut end of the pipe remaining in place got stuck in the shear not allowing the shear to completely release while trying to free the shear the weight of the pipe shifted note the shear operator stated he made no back and forth movement of the equipment or shear attachment as this would result in significant movement of the pipe remaining on the rack only a cwccw rotation of the shear attachment was used but some movement of the pipe was unavoidable this movement placed added pressure to faps side of the tshaped pipe support it is hypothesized the weight shift caused the anchor bolts on the next pipe support down the line to fail due to moderate to severe corrosion to the embedded anchor plate andor anchor bolts the failure of the initial pipe supportanchor continued to transfer stresses down the line causing each pipe support to topple in turn domino effect eventually allowing approximately six hundred lf of the upper pipes to roll off the pipe support as anchor bolts continued to break and the pipe support were bent over the felling of upper pipes occurred over a six hundred and ten second period as the remaining pipe support system was compromised by the chain reactionit should be noted that the dropped object potential from pipe demolition operations has always been recognized and anticipated such that no personnel are ever permitted near piping being demolished while the applicable tra task risk assessment does not specifically mention the faps pipe rack hazards associated with demolition including from shearing and the potential for falling andor shifting objects are clearly identified to account for this recognized hazard strict are controls were established and adhered to whereby personnel are not permitted within or adjacent to the work zone established for demolition operations all faps operations were immediately halted and all personnel accounted for the scene was secured and documented assessments were then made to determine the stability of the toppled pipes and resulting damage if any fencing at the south end of the faps pipe corridor where the remaining vertical piping at the gilligan st pipe bridgearch was observed to have sustained some damage the hydraulic shear was repositioned and short lengths of piping was carefully cut and removed using only heavy equipment to clear the fouled area after the area was cleared the damaged fencing was restored to reestablish perimeter security to the faps property</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","
