"A young and inexperienced site worker was using a circular saw to cut plywood on site on Friday morning. The saw had its protective latch/cover removed to speed up the cutting of the plywood on site. While cutting the boards, that platform that was being used collapsed on one side causing the worker to loose his balance and fall to the ground with the saw. The spinning disc of the saw caused a cut in the knee of the worker. The worker was treated with first aid before being transported to accident and emergency department of James's hospital for treatment. He received 20 stitches for the wound and was discharged home.",lack of competency

"Worker broke leg when he became partially trapped in a collapsed trench excavation. Site crew were digging sever trench on the south of the site (approximately 1.5 m deep) when one of the workers climbed down into the trench to inspect some water ingress. The trench was not shored or protected. After investigation, it was found that the site crew were inexperienced and were operating without oversight from a senior crew member. They were not supposed to dig the trench as deep as they did on the day but there was no toolbox talk held that morning (pre-task). Worker was brought to hospital by ambulance for treatment.",lack of competency
"Employee partially fell through rooflight while performing inspection scraping his ankle and leg.  The employee was not using the available fall arrest system while performing the  inspection. After investigation, it became clear that the employee had not received the correct training in how to recognise fall hazards and dangers or to properly use safety equipment. ",lack of competency
Employee overturned a dump truck while moving materials to south of the site. Employee injured his leg in the incident and was treated with first aid. He was sent to the hospital for x-ray but no significant damage to the leg is expected. The employee was not qualified to drive the dumper truck. His supervisor was not aware that the IP had taken the dumper without permission.,lack of competency
"Small-scale scaffold collapse on the north of the site, nobody injured, near-miss. On investigation it transpired that the scaffold had been erected by an unqualified team who did not have the required certification to erect the scaffold structure. ",lack of competency
"A last-minute site visit was requested for the project. An employee was sent to site without having the required induction or Site Safety training, as the dispatching office thought neither credentials were required due to being escorted by a Cat 5 safety watch. The deficiency was noted when the HSE department reviewed the Journey Management plan and noted the lack of required pre-access training. The site visit was cancelled and the employee left the site.",lack of competency
"An operator was caught offloading a manlift from a trailer on site without the required trained to use the equipment (no appropriate training card). We later received the training card.  Also, when questioned, the operator stated he did not think he needed a harness as he was not planning to work from the boom. He was just off loading it and going to park it on the ROW for later use by the crew.",lack of competency
"A subcontractor working under direct supervision, was performing survey duties along the proposed service route. While performing her duties, she climbed down into an open excavation. The excavation was new and still under construction, i.e., no benching/shoring had been installed in the location. Once she was spotted by workers in the area, she was asked to climb out of the excavation. The risk of working within that excavation without the required shoring had not been properly understood by the subcontractor. There was a clear lack of basic safety training and awareness. The issue will be taken up with the subcontractor management and HSE leadership team.",lack of competency
"Workers were moving materials by trailer and truck as part of the service metering project. While in transit the suspension of the trailer failed on one side, the load became unstable, shifted to one side and over turned the trailer. No injuries were sustained to the work crew. On investigation it was found that the suspension system on the trailer was designed for roadworks only and not suitable for the proposed off-road and heavy load transportation tasks. A visible pre-start check was completed on the day for the trailer and truck but it was not documented. This work was part of the minor works undertaken by the maintenance team. Training was provided for 4WD as per TNA but no training is currently required for trailers, in relation to hitching, pre-checks or load restraint.  No record found and not required under profile within contract training. Nonetheless the incident was a result of lack of competency and supervision on site. The workers involved were inexperienced and working without senior supervision.",lack of competency
"Employee was entering the south section of the site when he turned sharply off-track and drove over a free-standing conduit marker for an open land drain. The employee claims he did not see the marker and that he was in a hurry back from the storage yard with materials that were required from the day. The employee's driving was reckless and dangerous. His driving privileges on site have been revoked/suspended until he undergoes successful refresher (site driving) training and an eye test. Only minor damage to the marker was recorded, no injuries were sustained.",lack of competency
"A scaffold crew were dismantling a scaffold in the CAFS zone at the southeast corner of the LANS facility. The crew were under pressure to complete the work so as the next phase could commence. During the work, a transom accidently swung and hit off a break glass unit resulting in the Break Glass unit being activated. The crew were working too fast and dangerously, while under pressure. Due to this incident we have had a number of operational stand-downs with all employees to give 20-second 'step back' training.",lack of competency
"IP was lifting a large plastic storage box with handles from the floor to move it out of the way so as to access equipment stored behind.  When he lifted the box he immediately felt a twinge in his lower back. The plastic boxes are stored on the floor and stacked one on top of the other, mostly 3 to 4 boxes high. The boxes have to be accessed at least once a week to access the equipment in the that room.  The boxes are estimated to between 10-15kg. When the IP was asked if he had received Manual Handling training, he said that he had attended a course some years ago but had no follow-up or refreshers since. Suggested immediate corrective action is to rearrange the shelving in a more appropriate (easy-to-access) way.  The storage boxes should be stored at a more accessible height (not at floor level). When he has recovered, the ID should attend a refresher training course in manual handling/lifting before being asked to perform such lifting activities again.",lack of competency
"While excavating a trench over an existing buried services conduit, the bucket of the excavator made contact with the conduit causing a tear/damage approximately 6 inches square. The spotter was not paying attention during the task and did not give sufficient warning to the machine operator that the bucket was operating too close to the exposed conduit. On investigation, it was clear that the worker performing the spotter role did not have the required training/certification to perform the spotter task. Investigation is ongoing.

"IP suffered tendon injury to his right shoulder while moving scaffold material that had been returned from site. IP reported the discomfort the day after the incident and attended his GP where he received diagnosis and a prescription for medication. When questioned about the incident, the IP said that he did think that there were any additional factors that impacted the incident. The operation of moving the materials is fairly routine and an operation that the IP has performed the task each week since he started on the site. The injury have been caused by over-reaching / over-loading, the IP said that he did try to move four scaffold tubes at the same time. IP had not yet received his Manual Handling training due to delay in scheduling by P&O. IP should not have been given these tasks to do before he had received the training. The incident occurred in the scaffold yard and weather conditions were dry with no wind.",lack of competency
"A work crew excavating ground at the front of the site with a 6T excavation machine struck a buried 300mm underground storm pipe. The line strike caused the discharge of a large volume of water to excavated and adjoining area. The crew did not seek an underground services map for the area before commencing the work. The crew did not use a service tracker or perform a high-level evaluation of the site for existing services / storm routes / manholes, etc. The crew were relatively inexperienced and were operating in the area without senior oversight. Recommend tool-box talk and safety briefing on the importance of following the correct procedures and protocols when excavating ground. Provide 'safety moment' material from other incidents where line strike caused significant injuries or outages for use during the briefing sessions. Overall awareness and competency for performing such dangerous work tasks should be improved. Follow-up consultation planned for May-18.",lack of competency
"A complaint was received from the client regarding an unsafe act. During supervisor inspection rounds, a dangerous practice was observed in storage area XH89009. During the inspection, a local crew working on some light maintenance tasks were found using a flammable material (thinners) with a wire brush and a non-compliant soldering iron.  The inspector intervened to stop the work. When questioned about the activity, it was clear that  dangerous use of materials (wire brush) with flammable material (thinner) in the working area was not understood by the work crew.  Awareness training on the use of materials in ATEX areas is recommended for all crews on site.",lack of competency
"The boom of the site crane cam in contact with am overhead powerline while being relocated.  The correct details of the task were not recorded on job safety assessment (JSA). Specifically, the planned travel path (waypoints) were not plotted/checked, and the route was not walked/validated by the team before moving the crane's location. The worker who was tasked with spotting responsibility, had no training for spotting/banks-man. Several attempts, verbal and visual were made to stop crane from moving forward were ignored by the operator.",lack of competency
Fall arrest system not correctly installed. Roof workers beginning roof maintenance brought the faulty arrest system to the attention of the site foreman. The systems was not anchored to all assigned location and some of the fixings were visibly loose.,lack of competency
"During the inspection of the south S356 turbine, the ladder slider mechanism had fallen from the overhead platform. It happened when the operator was trying to engage his slider on the ladder. The operative involved in the incident did not have a recognised WAH certificate. The operative is to undertake the required training and has been suspended from climbing until the required training/certification is in place. The platform hatch was closed which prevented the dropped object from falling more than 2m. No injuries occurred. It should be noted that the operative was wearing all the correct PPE at the time (harness helmet etc, lanyards). The mechanism for attaching the slider is known to quite difficult to engage hence having the required training and competence is important to avoid incidents.",lack of competency
"A worker was reversing a vehicle with trailer towards the rear of the site when the he jack-knifed the trailer and caused damage to the rear of the vehicle. The weather was good, it was a bright day with no rain or wind - good visibility.  The worker involved in the incident said that it was his first time to reverse a vehicle with a trailer. His driving license did not cover movement of loads in a trailer of the size involved in the incident. The worker did not have the required competence or training to perform the task. No injuries were reported. He will meet with his supervisor on Friday to discuss training and ticket requirements. The worker has been told that he cannot drive a site vehicle with trailer until he has the required training and certification/license.",lack of competency
"A compressed asbestos fibrous gasket attached to a flange face was identified in the workshop following an inspection and subsequent intervention by the hot work team lead. A risk assessment was completed for the planned hot work activity and the flange was in the workshop for the repair of a crack.  In preparation for the welding repair of the crack, the flange was moved from the workshop entrance to the back walls by one welder using a forklift truck. The welder may have been exposed to asbestos when his clothing contacted the gasket.   The flange had been removed from service several days prior by the mechanical team. The welder had not attended any asbestos familiarisation training prior to the exposure. A review shall be conducted of the training status of all welders on site. An awareness briefing shall be held next week on site to remind all workshop crews to be aware of asbestos and the dangers of exposure.",lack of competency
"On Saturday the 15th June, two workers (a general operative and a carpenter) were found to be demolishing part of the south concourse wall in a dangerous and unplanned way. The operatives were asked to begin work on the demolition of an opening for a new double door. Using pneumatic hammers and manual sledge hammers they began opening up the brick wall in the required inverted V shape. The two workers were left unattended for a couple of hours and when the site agent returned he noticed that they opening was too wide at the top and in danger of collapse as no needle supports had been installed yet. The site agent stopped the work, set up an exclusion zone and instructed the temporary works contractor to install the needles before work on the demolition recommenced. The two workers did not have the required experience and competence to conduct the task, and they were working unattended. A site briefing to be help on Wednesday with all hands to discuss upcoming demolition works and the required working procedures.",lack of competency
"Site engineer observed to climb down into an approximate. 1.8m deep excavation that had not been shored/braced to check a level. The engineer is new to site and has only be working on the contract for the last 3 weeks. When questioned, he said that he did think that he needed to wait for shoring to be in place before checking the level. He said that it was a very quick task and the workers were under significant pressure to complete the pit so that reinforcement cage could be lowered into position before concrete arrived in the afternoon. A refresher training course in working in excavations and confined spaces is to be arranged for the engineer and the incident is to be raised at the next weekly stand-up for safety briefing.",lack of competency
Site worker ripped his index finger while installing tying wire on rebar cage. The IP received a one inch laceration/cut to his index finger that required 20 stitches. The worker stepped into to help expedite the steel fixing team that were under pressure to complete a ground beam cage for a scheduled afternoon concrete pour. The IP was not certified or trained to be performing steel fixing work. The site foreman was unaware that the IP was involved in the tying. Senior members of the steel fixing crew should have intervened when the IP volunteered to assist with the work. The incident is to be raised during the weekly all-hands safety awareness briefing.,lack of competency
