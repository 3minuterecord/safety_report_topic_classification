the shutdown blowdown of the processonce safe it was established that the leak had occurred due to the failure of a neoprene faced phenolic type f insulating gasket fitted to a thirty-four one

sixteen turnaround tar and pressure tested using nitrogen on december the 8th two thousand and sixteen to fifty-two two barg due to unrelated issues although the gasket had been fitted for one hundred and seventy-nine days it had only seen service for a total of forty days twenty-two days of which gc1 was operating at a steady continuous pressure of one hundred and twenty barg and one hundred and twenty degrees c temperature until failure see ad nineteen for gc1 up time pdi 2106a was stripped down to reveal the failed gasket a large cross section had been ejected from the joint the remainder of the gasket was sent to a company called element for failure mode analysis see ad one for the full analysis reportan immediate investigation was carried out offshore culminating in an instruction being given to all of taqa north sea assets to review their purchasing system and joint integrity management system jims to identify any similar gaskets that had been purchased and placed into service in three hundred systems following indepth discussions with klinger the gasket manufacturer a decision was reached that only vcs or shield ht type gaskets would be used for this type of critical hydrocarbon service in the future because they are manufactured using a steel core as opposed to phenolic see ad12the review of similar type gaskets on the tern identified a total of ten ten phenolic type f insulating gaskets see ad2 these have all since been changed out for either a vcs type gaskets or b shield ht gasketsthere were three separate companies that fulfilled the requisition for this failed gasket hpf steadfast klinger if taqa had requisitioned the gasket directly from klinger klinger stated that they would have discussed the limitations of this type of gasket due to the fact hpf sourced the gasket from steadfast who in turn sourced the gasket from klinger klinger had no knowledge of who the end user wasthe ability to source a gasket with minimal process information was one of the causal factors of this incident had the temperature pressure and process fluid been communicated to the supplier this neoprene faced phenolic type f insulating gasket would not have been suppliedthe gasket that failed had been labelled by the manufacturer as a thirty-four insulating kit suitable for one thousand, five hundred service further investigation has demonstrated the gasket had operating parameters of only forty barg pressure and one hundred and seven degrees c temperatureadditional testing of the same type f insulating gaskets took place at baker hughes with assistance from hydratight see ad three for the testing method statement that was carried out complete with the full results the summary findings from the testing demonstrated that when torqued to one hundred and twelve newton meters nm and hydro tested to one hundred and twenty barg at ambient room temperature the same type gasket was found to be in serviceable condition when inspected at 140nm applied torque one hundred and twenty-five of the original 112nm value there was measureable outside circumference growth further torque was then applied to the test joint in an attempt to reach the torque value required for a spiral wound gasket 186nm the test gasket was crushed before reaching the target torque value of 186nm when the maximum compressive strength of the gasket was exceeded the circumference growth of the gasket was such that the gasket was in contact with all four bolt sleeves and the gasket had crackedthe testing was completed in a controlled environment test bay with little or no background noise because of this the gasket failure was easily seenheard and felt by the torque engineer however the investigation team were of the opinion that an individual fitting the same type gasket in an offshore environment may not have seenheard nor felt the gasket failing while they were applying torquethe element failure analysis report determined that the measured compressive strength of the actual failed gasket was one hundred and eighty mpa this is a huge variance to the information contained within the manufacturer supplied data sheet stated at 350mpa see

286,21523,faps aboveground piping support system failure summaryduring demolition operations on the above grade piping at the fapsnavy st corridor the upper set of sixty-eight diameter piping shifted on the upper piping rack which in turn compromised the corroded pipe support system which subsequently allowed the pipes to fall in an unplanned fashion the pipe bridges arches at gilligan st and the fapsnavy st entrance had been removed previously in addition to allowing vehicles to drive underneath it is surmised the arches also prevented the horizontal lengths of pipe from rotating from pipe demolition performed up to this point removal of the arches at both ends of the faps pipe corridor both ends effectively unrestrained the six hundred feet of pipe remaining in between the arches movement of the pipes during demolition in other areas had been previously observed therefore attempts to restrain the pipe using chain binders and welding were made but proved to be insufficient the deteriorated condition of the pipe support rack and associated anchors severe corrosion ultimately lead to the entire pipe support system being compromised to varying degrees the morning of nineteen april scheduled predemolition activities took place consisting of removing sections of chain link fencing conduits and smallbore pipes laying down plastic tarps to catch paint chips etc in the afternoon pipe demo operations recommenced pipe demo operations are conducted by heavy equipment utilizing two excavators cutting up the pipe into twenty foot sections for transportrecycling one excavator is equipped with a grapple and the other with a hydraulic shear the grapple grips the pipe about ten feet from the end of the pipe midway between the end and the shear point while the grapple holds the pipe in place the shear will cut the pipe the grapple will then remove the cut section of pipe which is placed into a rolloff container in the afternoon while shearing sections of the upper pipe runs a piece of metal from the cut end of the pipe remaining in place got stuck in the shear not allowing the shear to completely release while trying to free the shear the weight of the pipe shifted note the shear operator stated he made no back and forth movement of the equipment or shear attachment as this would result in significant movement of the pipe remaining on the rack only a cwccw rotation of the shear attachment was used but some movement of the pipe was unavoidable this movement placed added pressure to faps side of the tshaped pipe support it is hypothesized the weight shift caused the anchor bolts on the next pipe support down the line to fail due to moderate to severe corrosion to the embedded anchor plate andor anchor bolts the failure of the initial pipe supportanchor continued to transfer stresses down the line causing each pipe support to topple in turn domino effect eventually allowing approximately six hundred lf of the upper pipes to roll off the pipe support as anchor bolts continued to break and the pipe support were bent over the felling of upper pipes occurred over a six hundred and ten second period as the remaining pipe support system was compromised by the chain reaction it should be noted that the dropped object potential from pipe demolition operations has always been recognized and anticipated such that no personnel are ever permitted near piping being demolished while the applicable tra task risk assessment does not specifically mention the faps pipe rack hazards associated with demolition including from shearing and the potential for falling andor shifting objects are clearly identified to account for this recognized hazard strict are controls were established and adhered to whereby personnel are not permitted within or adjacent to the work zone established for demolition operations all faps operations were immediately halted and all personnel accounted for the scene was secured and documented assessments were then made to determine the stability of the toppled pipes and resulting damage if any fencing at the south end of the faps pipe corridor where the remaining vertical piping at the gilligan st pipe bridgearch was observed to have sustained some damage the hydraulic shear was repositioned and short lengths of piping was carefully cut and removed using only heavy equipment to clear the fouled area after the area was cleared the damaged fencing was restored to reestablish perimeter security to the faps property,1,0,1
