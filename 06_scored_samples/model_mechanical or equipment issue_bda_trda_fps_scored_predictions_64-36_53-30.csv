the shutdown blowdown of the processonce safe it was established that the leak had occurred due to the failure of a neoprene faced phenolic type f insulating gasket fitted to a thirty-four one thousand, five hundred flange assembly connected to gas compression train 1the failed gasket had been fitted on the 26th of november two thousand and sixteen during the planned two thousand and sixteen turnaround tar and pressure tested using nitrogen on december the 8th two thousand and sixteen to fifty-two two barg due to unrelated issues although the gasket had been fitted for one hundred

twenty degrees c temperature until failure see ad nineteen for gc1 up time pdi 2106a was stripped down to reveal the failed gasket a large cross section had been ejected from the joint the remainder of the gasket was sent to a company called element for failure mode analysis see ad one for the full analysis reportan immediate investigation was carried out offshore culminating in an instruction being given to all of taqa north sea assets to review their purchasing system and joint integrity management system jims to identify any similar gaskets that had been purchased and placed into service in three hundred systems following indepth discussions with klinger the gasket manufacturer a decision was reached that only vcs or shield ht type gaskets would be used for this type of critical hydrocarbon service in the future because they are manufactured using a steel core as opposed to phenolic see ad12the review of similar type gaskets on the tern identified a total of ten ten phenolic type f insulating gaskets see ad2 these have all since been changed out for either a vcs type gaskets or b shield ht gasketsthere were three separate companies that fulfilled the requisition for this failed gasket hpf steadfast klinger if taqa had requisitioned the gasket directly from klinger klinger stated that they would have discussed the limitations of this type of gasket due to the fact hpf sourced the gasket from steadfast who in turn sourced the gasket from klinger klinger had no knowledge of who the end user wasthe ability to source a gasket with minimal process information was one of the causal factors of this incident had the temperature pressure and process fluid been communicated to the supplier this neoprene faced phenolic type f insulating gasket would not have been suppliedthe gasket that failed had been labelled by the manufacturer as a thirty-four insulating kit suitable for one thousand, five hundred service further investigation has demonstrated the gasket had operating parameters of only forty barg pressure and one hundred and seven degrees c temperatureadditional testing of the same type f insulating gaskets took place at baker hughes with assistance from hydratight see ad three for the testing method statement that was carried out complete with the full results the summary findings from the testing demonstrated that when torqued to one hundred and twelve newton meters nm and hydro tested to one hundred and twenty barg at ambient room temperature the same type gasket was found to be in serviceable condition when inspected at 140nm applied torque one hundred and twenty-five of the original 112nm value there was measureable outside circumference growth further torque was then applied to the test joint in an attempt to reach the torque value required for a spiral wound gasket 186nm the test gasket was crushed before reaching the target torque value of 186nm when the maximum compressive strength of the gasket was exceeded the circumference growth of the gasket was such that the gasket was in contact with all four bolt sleeves and the gasket had crackedthe testing was completed in a controlled environment test bay with little or no background noise because of this the gasket failure was easily seenheard and felt by the torque engineer however the investigation team were of the opinion that an individual fitting the same type gasket in an offshore environment may not have seenheard nor felt the gasket failing while they were applying torquethe element failure analysis report determined that the measured compressive strength of the actual failed gasket was one hundred and eighty mpa this is a huge variance to the information contained within the manufacturer supplied data sheet stated at 350mpa see

wolff h w shipyard in northern ireland the weather at the time was raining and the ground conditions were described as very wet with pooling water evident the injured parties ips were given a task by their supervisor to modify an existing temporary scaffold platform erected at feeder station fs2 join up ht7 the under construction leg had three distinct habitats along its length these were1 the habitat modified by the ips and the location of the incident two a second habitat not in use three a third habitat with ongoing welding activity during the course of carrying out modifications both ips experienced electric shocks the severity of the incident was not immediately obvious as a precaution both ips were taken to belfast mater a e for medical assessment both scaffolders were kept in hospital overnight for observation they were later transferred to the royal victoria hospital burns unit when the extent of their injuries became clear the ip with the most significant injuries burn and exit wound was visited on sixteen march eighteen by wood and h w management in hospital to check on his condition and see firsthand the extent of the ips injuries both ips were released from hospital on sixteen march eighteen a stand down initiated by the client h w and an electrical inspection was carried out on the welding kits and other electrical equipment on the fs stations on 15th march eighteen an email was received from the h w operations director stating that no electrical faults could be found on the welding arrangements and or any other portable electrical equipment being used on fs2 feeder station as there was no obvious root because of the incident fs2 remained closed for further investigation the wgis hse manager attended site nineteen march eighteen in order to assess the situation and to commence an incident investigation process the initial investigation terms of reference tors envisaged was to assist h w with the overall investigation and produce a joint report to inform on all aspects of the incident which would ensure that lessons were jointly learned and implemented the tors were modified after an initial visit on site to consider wgis aspects only following a meeting with h w twenty march eighteen wgis were invited to review the electrical arrangements at fs2 specifically the welding electrical arrangements to and within the habitats there were no immediately obvious root causes that would explain the electric shocks which the ips had received a specialist electrical engineer see was contacted by wgis to attended site and assess report on the electrical installation and potential sources of electrical shock discharge the see met with the h w electrical team facilities manager which was followedup by a walk round of the incident site electrical set up a draft report has subsequently been issued for review following the visit a final report is anticipated on twenty-eight march eighteen the report initial feedback concludes that there are no obvious electrical deficiencies which would lead to an electrical shock discharge that were observed on the day of the walkround it was not clear at the time if the electrical setup had been modified or changed between walk round and the site incident subsequent to the incident the wgis safe systems of works were checked by the wgis she manager and all required documentation and briefing were found to be in order summary of investigationfindings1 the immediate because was as follows electrical shock two the root because was as follows exposure to significant electrical current the source of the electrical shock discharge has not been identified three the immediate actions taken were all welding works were suspended across the site an immediate site investigation carried out by h w assisted by two external 3rd parties the investigation involved a review of the weld electrical arrangements at fs2 note the arrangements at each habitat are similar in installation and setup all scaffold works were stopped on habitats adjacent to ongoing welding works until confirmation of the suitability of the electrical installation or any remediation actions were undertaken to prevent a possible reoccurrence summary of longer term sustainable actions h w to confirm the control measures which have put in place for the remainder of the east anglia project to ensure wgis
