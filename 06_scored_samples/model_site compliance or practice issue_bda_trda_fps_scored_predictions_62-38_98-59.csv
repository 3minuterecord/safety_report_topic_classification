initial findings of wgpsn svgs investigation are that changes in work scope identified that there may be a x2 spools increase to x3 spools for removal from the avenue b location at 5th street gn preempted changes and drew up second lift plan to ensure no delay should work scope request two or three spools to be removed the necessary amendments were updated and the crane was booked in for monday 11th of january and tuesday 12th of january the crane was unavailable after the 12th of january due to other bp contract priorities all rigging permits complied with the mechanical permit was correct for the task to be executed in conjunction with the wg riggers there was a delay in the mechanical permit going live due to an isolation which did not get confirmed until the 13th of january at one thousand, two hundred and fifty at this stage it is clear to see that the crane is no longer an option for the spool removal as it is no longer booked to this task the drr on the mechanical permit for the 13th of jan was completed and clearly states that stop the job triggers shall occur when there is a change in work scope there had been an initial pre permit creation conversation about manual handling the spools into a positon where the hiab could then pick up the spools this had been suggested to the cow but had been rejected as a viable option the cow had recommended that the spools be lifted by crane this ultimately led to the initial lift plan but then changed due to the increase in spool numbers as the crane was only booked for two days the necessary permit requirements for the mechanical breaking containment permit had not been satisfied and the crane was then unavailable as a result a further discussion was then held between sg cm and gh surrounding the original suggestion of manual handling the spools it was agreed amongst sg cm and gh to explore by the means of a manual handling risk assessment mhra the viability of performing the required task should this be an acceptable and safe method of removal the mechanical permit clearly states that the removal of spools would be performed by the rigging department on a separate permit the only mention of manual handling considerations was for the flexible hoses the mhra was requested by gh of mb assistance for the mhra was also provided by ld and jb for the task when the mhra had been completed there was a discussion amongst the persons that were at the work face these persons were jn jnt jm ld gs jb mb and cd the discussion surrounded the safest method of spool removal accounting for the hazards to be mindful of and including five persons the weight was not known at this stage but a partial lift to gauge the suitability of a multi person lift was carried out and it was determined that the number of persons at the work face at this time was deemed sufficient the weight of the spools was approximately 165kg as per the lift plan and approximately 12m long the work party then proceeded to clear the area for slips and trips and identify a clear route of removal at this point the proposed change of work should have been communicated to the cow for approval clearly stating the proposed method on the mhra suitably trained and sufficient personnel should have been identified to carry out the task and then the relevant persons complete a drr and sign onto the permit only four persons involved in the task were actually signed onto the permit the other persons within the vicinity of the spool not mentioned on the mechanical permit were observing or advising but were asked to assist with the spool lift to satisfy the mhra requirements ld jb gs and mb were all involved in the physical lifting of the spool the failing at this stage was that they had not read the permit conducted a drr or signed onto the permit had the permit been read then this may have identified that the wcc stated the wg riggers were to conduct the lift and this may have raised questions lsr1 control of work no management of change was considered as part of the mhra thought process individuals were not aware they were to sign on to the permit no drr was completed or chunks considered as part of the taskthe

119,5722,during a planned intervention to upgrade the hp flare meter the power supply failed the impact of this was data loss which has resulted in a notification made to the environment agency for the euets permit incident 31462summary of cairs incident hp flare meter failureduring a planned intervention to upgrade the hp flare meter starting on the 19th september a problem occurred in powering up the new replacement field flow computer the hp flare was due to be recommissioned on the 23rd september however due to this issue it did not start functioning until the 27th september a notification was made to the environment agency and the data gaps methodology as stated in the cats euets procedure was applied for this period detaileda requirement was identified in two thousand and fourteen to upgrade the hp flare meter by installing the newer fgm one hundred and sixty previously fgm one hundred and thirty technology as advised by the manufacturer the aim of which was to improve the reliability of current readings the scope was to install a new hp flare meter in the field in place of obsolete equipment direct replacement with same tag numbers and reconfigure the cable infrastructure to maintain signal integrity during installation problems were encountered with the power supply the cable installed was too long which resulted in insufficient power to the meter attempts were made to utilise the existing power cable and also to attempt to reinstate the old flare meter however both attempts proved unsuccessful a notification was submitted to the environment agency on the 24th september to make them aware of the situation on 26th september functionality was reestablished and the contracting engineer configured the new meter following this the hp flare meter became operational again by fourteen zero on the 27th september this is a temporary measure until a field power supply can be installed due to lead times design checks and moc processes this is anticipated as being late q4 two thousand and sixteen to early q1 two thousand and seventeen a further update was issued to the environment agency on 29th september investigationexecutive summaryon the 23rd september two thousand and sixteen the hp flare meter failed to power up as planned meaning that there were no meter readings from the 23rd of september until the 27th september this resulted in a period of being noncompliant with the monitoring and reporting regulation mrr of the cats euets permit the environment agency was notified without delay please refer to attached notification and response from the environment agency sequence of eventsit was identified in summer two thousand and thirteen that although the flare gas metering systems were working correctly they were twenty years old and many of the operating components were now or becoming obsolete this presented concerns regarding future reliability of the system a project was set up in two thousand and fourteen to look at other suppliers to manage this potential failure however the project was put on hold in november two thousand and fourteen in december two thousand and fourteen the lp system failed cats technicians cleaned and replaced the probes but this did not fix the issue abel fluenta engineers were then brought in to investigate the fault it was found that a failed lp electronics board in the fgm130 flow computer was the source of this issue this resulted in data loss of a month until the start of january two thousand and fifteen when a replacement fgm160 field flow computer was installed and commissioned kelton were then brought in to do an uncertainty report on both the hp and lp flare meters as the hp used the same system as the lp flare it was predicted that the same failure could be expected the original date for the hp flare meter replacement was planned for october two thousand and fifteen however due to taspas issues this was delayed as further design was required at the start of two thousand and sixteen the replacement field flow computer for the hp flare additional junction box was installed and cables moved added to facilitate a quick cut over to the new hp flare meter due to workloads the upgrade was not carried out in q2 two thousand and sixteen and q3 was also not possible due to the tar a decision was made by the cats leadership team to defer until q3 two thousand and sixteen the hp flare meter failed on the 23rd september which meant that there were no meter readings for five days this resulted in a noncompliance with the euets permit which could have led to a financial penalty and potential reputational damage from the environment agency noncompliances are made publically available as the permit is in the name of cats north sea limited any fines would have been on the client immediate causes failed power supply to the hp flare meter root system causes age of the flare metering system twenty years old and obsolete equipment leading to a decrease in reliability meant that an upgrade was required recommendations to prevent system recurrenceas both flare metering systems have been upgraded and there are additional improvements being implemented to the system e g it is considered that the risk of recurrence is extremely low however there are other combustion sources on the euets permit which require continued management it is acknowledged that the hp flare meter upgrade project was deferred on several occasions and that a commitment had been made to the environment agency by the previous operator to complete this upgrade in two thousand and fifteen it is possible that the environment agency could have responded differently leaving cnsl and wood group exposed to financial and reputational impact given that wood group do not own the euets permit but manage it as part of our role of operating partner it is highly recommended that going forward any potential issues which can have an impact on compliance with the permit are escalated to the correct level and captured on the site risk register a precautionary approach should be adopted where by any potential concerns are directed to the cats environmental advisor and actioned appropriately see detailed description,1,0,1
