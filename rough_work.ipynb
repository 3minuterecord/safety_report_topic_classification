      "no factual evidence had been present to suggest otherwise.client control of works:the control of works for working on the paint booth roofs had been through a generic task risk assessment (tsra0021) to which the mpact engineer would adhere to for such task ensuring that should work be carried out on the roofs then a loto procedure would take place for overhead crane isolation or the crane operation pendant would be removed from use by wgis and placed in the care of the mpact engineer whilst works were on-going.\n",
