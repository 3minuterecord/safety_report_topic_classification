The operation was to install a king post as part of piling operations. Wood riggers were employed in the lifting/moving of the auger and king post upon request by the piling contractor.A Giken piling rig was positioned on its reaction stand ready to install the north side king post, the first of two such piles. The pre auger activity was completed in accordance with the method statement and the auger was removed and laid down. The king post was inserted into the hole until it grounded and then the Giken began to drive the pile down. The king post is approximately 11m long and at what I would estimate to be 2/3 installed the rig was unable to drive the pile any further due to an obstruction. At this point it was considered that refusal was  likely due to collapse of the augered hole at the bottom or a section of hard ground (rock) snagging the pileThe pile was removed and the auger reintroduced to clear the obstruction. The auger brought what looked like water, wet clay and gravel to the surface. The auger was removed and laid down and at approximately 17:00hrs the pile was reinserted through the Giken clamp mechanism and into the hole. The pile was lowered into the hole suspended on the 100Te crane. With what is estimated to be around 4m of the pile out of the ground(housed in the piling equipment) the pile grounded again and the weight came off the crane. Without warning and before the Giken clamp mechanism could get hold of the pile to continue driving operations, the obstruction in the hole gave way and the pile dropped into the hole. The shock load broke the sling at the mid-point (the sling was doubled to the hook) and the pile came to rest with what is estimated to be 2.5m still above ground.The post was housed in such a way that the only way that it could travel would be in a downward direction.        ","The king post was driven into its final position, this part of the operation did not include crane lifting activities, and operations were suspended. Communication was held the the crane hire company and they gave assurance that the shock load applied to the sling did not affect the integrity of the crane.  The sling was inspected by the lifting accessory hire company and they gave assurance that the failure of the sling was due to the shock load applied to it.   The documentation for the task was reviewed and the lifting operations methodology for positioning the gate post was revised. Following this revision all key stakeholders were part of a pre-start team brief and agreement was reached on the way forward to achieve a safe operation.

This involved repeatedly filling 4 x 205lts drums, fitting them with lids, transporting them to and from a laydown area, then moving them from the laydown area by forklift, to a flat bed vehicle to be transported offsite to Murphy's yard and unloaded. The process of adsorbent removal involves filling all 4 drums using a double drum filler hopper (2 first, move the filler, then the two remaining drums) then fitting lids to each of the drums, then the forklift would be called forward to move the pallet to the laydown area location onsite,  for the drums to be labelled and secured for onward travel. The work scope, was controlled under permit 16219 - Discharge spent Puraspec adsorbent from V-2704 A, and the forklift / vehicle movements was controlled under permit 15168, adsorbent changeout vehicle movements. All personnel involved in the work scope had a tool box talk (TBT), reviewed the Risk Assessments and signed the work party declaration, as having understood the hazards of the work scope and the controls required to be followed. During one of these pallet & drum movements, one of the Johnson Matthey sub-contractors (Technivac) personnel has requested the forklift driver to move into the forward position to pick up a pallet and 4 drums. The forklift driver has proceeded forward and lifted the pallet c/w drums, and lifted the forks approximately 30/40mm, at this point one of the Technivac employee's has alerted the forklift driver to stop and made a movement forward towards the forklift and load, to apparently secure a loose lid on one of the drums. At this point the forklift driver has immediately stopped the forklift, due to the individual encroaching in the way of the forklift and load. Once the lid had been readjusted / secured, the forklift driver completed the task and removed the pallet c/w drums to the laydown area while the remainder of the work party continued to manually handle drums and unload adsorbent, as per work scope task. Approximately 30mins later, the individual who approached the forklift to allegedly secure a loose lid, reported to the Technivac supervisor and complained of a sore wrist. At this point the individual was advised by the Technivac supervisor to report the incident further, which the individual allegedly declined to do.  Due to conflicting accounts, information and recollections of the incident by Technivac personnel and to provide some clarity as to whether an incident has actually occurred, Wood CATS has instructed Technivac to conduct a full investigation into the circumstances or the situation and report the findings of the investigation back to Wood CATS. Once the findings of this investigation have been concluded, then the CAIRS case and classification will be revisited.

The right rear tire of the skid steer went over the sloped edge of the ditch and the skid steer rolled into it, coming to rest on its right side.  Operator was not working with a spotter, but there was a ground man assigned to control access to the area for the duration of clean up. Operator reported no injuries and the next closest worker was ~25 feet off the front left side of the skid steer at time of incident.  There was no visible damage observed on the skid steer after being tipped back upright. An actual severity of A1 was selected as there were no injuries and no observable damage.  A potential severity of B2 was determined due to the potential for the operator to have been injured during roll over and potential for damage to the skid steer.","Work stopped, supervisor and client proponent notified.

During this process, the stillson wrench tool slipped, causing the IP's right hand ring finger to contact between the stillson wrench tool and the valve body.

The supervisor allocated the work to a fitter who has had experience on the Ampol site, then left to set up other work fronts. The fitter undertook this work activity following P&ID 6024233 on his own.The supervisor returned to the area (11C4) at approx. 3.30pm to check on the fitter’s progress and was informed by the fitter that he removed the blank end cap B623 and unbolted B625, bagged both ends, as they were to be worked on as per the P&ID. They were also in vicinity of 609 and Manway1 which he had completed as per permit and P&ID 6029228. P&ID 6029228 references work pack 6024233 that lists the blinds and instructions to unbolt and install. The fitter thought he could just ask the area operator to add these blinds to the permit after the job was completed. B623 was a redundant nozzle (N4A) which was to be removed and repaired as per P&ID instructions and B625 was fitted to a drain. Both the nozzle and drain were under the same isolations for the vessel and covered by the boundary isolations Plan No 6029822.The supervisor went to find the allocated area operator but could not find him, however, at approx. 5.00pm the supervisor found another operator to come over to the vessel and explained the permit requirements to the fitter instructing him in future not to perform work that is not prescribed on the permit. The operator reluctantly added the two blinds to the permit but was not happy about the circumstances. The permit was signed off and returned to the BRM and an incident was raised by the operator INC0024000.Causal factors: •	The fitter removed the additional blank on B623 and unbolted B625 as they were listed in the P&ID as scheduled work and in the vicinity of the blinds already installed however was not listed on the Permit.Root Cause:•	Wood fitter failed to follow the permit to work instructions on permit 092300.Recommendations: •	Toolbox to be delivered to T&I personnel regarding the PTW process and to reinforce the understanding that work scope and activity is limited to what is prescribed on the Permit to Work.•	The fitter be subject to Wood Group’s Fair and Just Culture process.",Report & escalate,,,,,,,,,"Civil Survey ",Work Authorisation,13712,13724,13726,20056197,11212,212,,,,,,Yes,2022-08-04 00:00:00.000,NULL,0,Wednesday,2022-08-04 07:28:28.000,Yes,Management Action,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2022-08-15 00:00:00.000,NULL,CAIRS_Incidents.csv

The crew signed off on the paperwork and entered radiological zone 3 to gain access to the McNally work barge. Once there, the workers positioned the work barge along the shoreline and secured it with the spuds once they were lined up and tied off to the anchors. The excavator was then moved into position with the boom and stick facing east towards the shore. This is where the exisiting extension stick and clam bucket was to be placed and the parallel extension was located that was installed onto the excavator. The crew began to disconnect the environmental bucket and set it down to the side of the work area. The excavator  lined up with the parallel stick extension on the shoreline. The next step involved a second excavator on the zone 1 side that was used to hoist the parallel extension so the excavator could place the main stick inside the extension unit. The parallel stick extension was lifted approx 3-4 feet in the air with appropriate rigging and the barge excavator was able to insert the stick inside the parallel extension and was then pinned in place by the workers on the ground. The parallel stick extension has one support bracket located on the operator side and was supported by a piece of wood and the main boom stick. The ground workers, both working together, decided to manually manouver the support bracket to the correct orientation, which is a procedural step not required at this time. As the workers were performing this task, they manually manouvered the support bracket as it pivoted in the air back towards the excavator. The first worker had their hands on the support bracket, lifted it up and rotated it back towards the excavator, away from the hydraulic hoses. The other worker was able to support the weight and was handed the control arm where it was brought under control using both hands ad guided to the desired location, to be placed against a collar which was sticking out from the parallel extension. While performing this movement, the IP had placed their left hand in a position which has been identified as ""in the line of fire"". The IP finished their task and reported to their supervisor where they were taken via boat to the boat dock to receive first aid treatment. After receiving first aid treatment on site, the IP was taken to Northumberland Hills Hospital by their supervisor for medical evaluation. The worker received 3 stitches to the top of their middle finger and two stitches to the bottom of their middle finger.","The work was placed in a safe state and the worker was removed from the work environment.

The walk back to the trucks on the previously establish path also passed through a few parsnip plants. Exposure either to a noxious oil covered tool or direct contact with the plant itself is unclear. However, in the evening of the 27th, IP experienced a linear bubbling burn on right mid-forearm (palm side) and noticed it while showering at home.

IP called work care which instructed him to keep the burn clean with  soap and water, to avoid aggravating it, and to call again if symptoms worsen. The new FS for the 28th (Dan Ionico) then conducted a thorough hazard assessment to mitigate potential parsnip exposure by deliniating a new path to site that avoids parsnips plants and all high growing weeds generally.

INCIDENT IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE IF WOOD’S HAS ANY ROLE / RESPONSIBILITY AS WORK WAS NOT IN RELATION TO THE WOOD SCOPE OF WORK.  BC Mechanical was contracted directly by Honeywell to install a fire protection line.  This installation of the fire protection line was not within Wood’s scope of work.  However, the line was installed within the boundaries of the Wood project site.  In addition, the Wood subcontractor, Brandenburg, was used to dig the trench.  Wood was not otherwise involved.  This was an additional work being conducted at an active facility. Trench was dug, pipes laid down but work was not completed by the end of the day so trench was left open.  A heavy rain event occurred over the weekend causing some washout of the backfill on the site.  On the following Monday, a BC Mechanical employee walked on the backfilled area to  inspect the trench and to assess it prior to continuing the installation of the fire protection line.  While walking, the ground gave way and the individual fell into a hole, approximately 5’ (or less) below grade while standing and ~10’ back from the leading edge of the excavation that was sloped back.  The site was the basement of a former building that our subcontractor (Brandenburg) demolished and backfilled.  Soil had been compacted and compaction tested by a 3rd party so was within compaction specifications.  There was no signs that this hole existed prior to it giving way and the individual falling in.  There is still no visual signs of washout in that specific area, although there was signs of washout in other areas of the site.  The BC Mechanical employee self rescued by using a strap attached to an excavator.  BC Mechanical employee reported only minor injuries.",Brandenburg assisted the EE out of the sinkhole using equipment for the employee to grab on to and self-rescue. EE went to the clinic for evaluation. The site was secured and no further entry allowed until an engineering inspection was completed.

At approx. 0520, the IP exited the Security Trailer as they needed to open up Gates #1 and #2 in preparation for the days activity. They went down the trailer stairs, which are supplied with the trailer unit by the trailer supplier.  The stairs are of metal construction, with the steps being metal framed with a grated tread welded to the frame from underneath.  There were no braces under the tread portion of the steps.  The stairs had recently been checked by Wood and Lakeland Multitrade in response to other stair related incidents on the Project and were found to be in serviceable condition.  The IP stepped down with their left foot onto the stair that was the second up from the bottom. They stepped down such that the heel of the foot was in the centre of the stair tread; the foot was turned to the left and slightly inclined to the left (i.e the foot was not placed flat onto the stair tread).  The IP was holding onto the handrail.  When the IP stepped down onto the stair, the tread became separated from the front steel framing (tack welds failed) in the centre area where the foot was placed.  The grated tread depressed approx. 1"". Due to the tread depressing unexpectedly and how the IP had stepped down onto the stair, the IP was put off balance resulting in the ankle rolling to the left.  As they were using the handrail at the time the IP did not fall. The IP was wearing 6"" CSA Grade 1 construction boots.  They were laced up, however the top eyelets were not used.The IP continued to complete their task and returned to the trailer.  As they were sitting in the trailer they elevated the foot and used over the counter pain medication.  The Wood H&S Manager was notified of the event at 0620 when arriving at the Project Site for the day, and investigation was undertaken, including interviewing the IP and taking photos.  The IP indicated that there was little pain except for when putting weight on the ankle when stepping.  The damaged stair was painted with high vis orange paint.  When the Ast Superintendent arrived shortly after, a discussion of what could be done with the stairs was held.  The Commissionaires worker coming in to start their shift at 0700 was notified of the hazard and to step off to the side of the weak tread location when accessing the trailer. During this time the IP was supplied with a rapid cold pack to apply to the ankle. Shortly after tailgate was completed, the stairs were replaced with a spare set that were available.  The replacement stairs were of a different design, having braces under the grated tread providing better support.The IP, after application of the cold pack, indicated that the ankle was much better.  The ankle was inspected and there was some minor swelling noted on the left side.  The IP indicated that they would wrap it with a tensor bandage when they got home and rest it.  They had no plan on seeking medical evaluation and were instructed to inform Wood if that were to happen.

The worker tripped on a survey stake that  was laying on an angle to the ground.  The worker fell forward and reached out to break their fall, by  extending their hands out in front.   The worker subsequently landed quite hard on their right hand and hyper extended their fingers back towards their wrist.   ","After the worker got up from the ground, massaging the affected hand, the sub-contractor's foreman arrived on site (a couple minutes later).  Worker spoke to athe sub-contractor's construction foreman, advising them of what happened.  Worker drove  to the on-site first aid, located approximately 1/2 KM away.    The worker's right hand was assessed, ice applied and hand was bandaged. The first aid attendant advised the worker to travel to Smtihers to get an x-ray of the hand.  When worker was at first aid, the prime contractor PM was passing by in their vehicle and was flagged down.  The worker advised the PM of the incident and  that the worker would drive to the hospital in Smithers for an x-ray.  (approx. 1  hour away).   Worker travelled out of the field, stopped at the client site trailer, approximately 20 kms away.  The worker  advised the client construction officer  of what happend.  He told the worker he had already been advised about the incident.  Worker continued on and drove to the Smither's Hospital.  Worker waited approximately 4 1/2 hours at the hospital before seeing a Doctor.  The hand was x-rayed and no fracture was identified.  The Doctor suspected a hairline fracture of the right ring finger.  As a precaution, the right ring finger was splinted/taped and worker advised to keep the splint on for 3-4 weeks, no heavy lifting during that time.  The worker was advised they could go back to work.    Immediate Corrective action: The prime contractor PM went back to Structure 9B, took a picture of the stake and removed it from the ground.   This incident is currently under investigation and more information will  follow.July 11 UPDATE: Worker was contacted by the Doctor previously seen in the ER.  X-ray was reviewed by a radiologist and no fracture was identified.  The finger was immobilized as a precautionary measure and the worker was advised the splint should be kept for at least 1 - 1/2 week.  No paperwork was given to the worker by the attending Doctor at the Hospital.   Worker will reach out to the Doctor to see if a soft immobilization measure can now be used.

The supplier arrived on site and proceeded to the Babcock HSSE Office. The Babcock HSE Officer was busy scanning documents for their head office so he only reviewed the certificates for the slings and the truck-mounted crane unit and the operator competency that was provided by Speedspace. The HSSE Officer from Babcock then requested the Rigging Supervisor for Pro-Rig to assist the Speedspace provider with the offloading of the unit as the Babcock-appointed Rigging Supervisor was in a training session and not available for the day.The Speedspace team then started to set up the lifting and placement of the unit when the rigging supervisor from Pro-Rig a Babcock Subcontractor appointed to perform the rigging scope of work on the burner replacement project noticed that the slings that the Speedspace team had already hooked up to the crane hook of the truck-mounted crane had some cuts in them. The rigging supervisor for Pro-Rig stopped the activity and then proceeded to replace the damaged sling with an undamaged one and after visually inspecting all of the other slings the Speedspace team had brought with them assisted the provider with offloading of the unit in the Babcock site establishment. The Speedspace lifting equipment was used to then offload the unit and not Pro-Rig equipment as reported in the initial report of the incident in CAIRS.A decision was made to use a Pro-Rig PTRA and only have the Speedspace team sign onto the Pro-Rig PTRA that was used the previous week for offloading containers in the same area with a mobile crane. The Pro-Rig supervisor then assisted the Speedspace team to offload and place the unit safely.After the unit had been placed the Wood HSSE Officer who had been at the work area arrived at the Babcock HSSE Officer's office and told him that the unit cannot be used due to it not having the correct steps and also showed him a photograph of the damaged sling that had been shown to him by the Pro-Rig Supervisor.Sometime after the unit was safely placed an audit was performed by the Wood Construction Manager Mr. Wickus Bester, as he had been in meetings during the lift, as a follow-up and due to the fact that Wood had not been informed of the lift prior to starting of the work.

The Lift Line was lowered and engaged with the section of flight auger. During the hoisting of the auger section the lift line was observed to snag and jump, following this, slack line was observed in the Rig's spool winch, which subsequently sustained ""bird caging"". An All Stop was called by the Seymour's Superintendant and a decision was made to pull out the lift wire in an attempt to remove the ""bird cage"" and slack line within the rigs spool drum, however during the pulling out of the Lift Wire it was identified that the Lifting Wire had sustained damaged and subsequently suffered fraying, an estimation of 3 - 5 broken strands and crush / cut damage. Seymour's & Foundation Piling made the decision to continue operations to finish the pile, for fear of the auger sections still within the ground becoming stuck or concreted in. The undertook this operation by a multitude of Utilization the Piling Rig to rotate the augers from the ground and the Excavator to detach lift the sections of auger free from the operational area.Following a period of time, the Pile was completed and Wood received a telephone call from Seymour's Project Manager informing them of the incident. Wood HSE Immediately requested a meeting, where a general overview of the Incident was relayed. Wood requested a full investigation and subsequent inspection of the rig and repair to follow. A period of 5 working days lapsed, before Wood was supplied with an Initial Incident Report, which has been attached to this CAIRS Report and upon receipt of the Incident Report Seymour's failed to provide sufficient information to determine the Initial and Root Cause and claimed the classification of the Incident was incorrect and the event was subsequently a breakdown and repair / replacement was classed as maintenance. Wood refused the suggested classification of the Incident. In addition to the above Wood HSE requested the rig to be Rig to be Inspected by a Competent Person to determine the Root Cause and assess for additional defects and damage. Wood HSE also requested the Piling Rig to be repaired with a re-certification inclusive of (Wire Rope Assurance / DC, Load Testing, Thorough Examination and Repair / Inspection Report). Seymour's removed the rig from Site and a Foundation Piling Operative removed and replaced the Lift Wire. Seymour's refused to undertake a Thorough Examination of the Piling Rig and subsequent repairs, to which Wood HSE refused to accept and informed Seymour's of LOLER Regulation 9 & Schedule 1 Requirements. Seymour's again refused to accept this guidance / instruction, so Wood HSE Consulted Wood's Technical Authority for Lifting, whom re-emphasized the same requirements under LOLER. In addition Wood's HSE requested the competency of the Foundation Piling, whom had performed the repair and re-spool of the Lifting Wire, Seymour's are yet to supply this information. Following a prolonged period of request and liaison's Seymour's have agreed to perform a Thorough Examination of the Equipment, however they requested this to be undertake, via the Piling Rig's Hire Company. Wood's HSE requested their competency to perform the thorough Examination, to which certification was supplied (Welding & Plant Mechanic) Wood refused the certification as no reference to Competency, Training or Experience was relating to PUWER & LOLER. Wood's HSE also re-consulted Wood's Technical Lifting Authority, whom verified Wood's HSE Concerns of the proposed Thorough Examiners Competencies. Wood's Technical Authority requested copies of the Examiners (LEEA's Certification). Wood HSE has relayed this request to Seymour's but the information is yet to be provided.

He felt the rear wheels raise up and so engaged the handbrake and left the vehicle in gear. He got out of the ute safely incurring no injury.The mechanical fitter came down from the Water Treatment Plant platform to see if his colleague was ok. He had witnessed the whole event. They had not radioed the event as within about two minutes, two emergency response personnel had pulled up on their way to another location. They called up Ampol Safety Specialist and organized to have the vehicle pulled out by site emergency services.Two Movement Operators were driving past. They stopped and chatted to both WOOD personnel to see if they were ok.It is noted in witness statements taken from WOOD personnel that one of the Movement Operators commented that the area near the culvert was quite narrow and should be barricaded.Emergency response used 4WD and snatch-strap to safely pull out the Ampol ute. The vehicle was checked for damage. No damage was noted.","It was agreed the WOOD HSE Lead would take down both Witness Statements on WOOD format and upload to Cintellate and CAIRS. She then escorted both WOOD personnel to the Security Gate so the driver of the vehicle could undergo both D&A routine testing. At no time was the driver of the vehicle involved in the event alone and did not consume any food of liquid.The third-party tester informed the WOOD HSE Lead that the D&A result was satisfactory (negative) and would be reported Ampol as per protocol.After the D&A test, the WOOD HSE lead recorded the Witness Statements on WOOD stationery. The Ampol Senior Safety Specialist emailed the WOOD HSE Lead photos of the ute in the ditch x 4.In the meantime, The Ampol Safety Specialist carried out an investigation into the root cause of the event and noted bollards highlighting similar conditions. the hazard where the event occurred had no controls in place and no warning of soft edge.The Ampol Safety Specialist reported the roadside hazard (long grass concealing soft edges on the side of the drain and culvert at the entrance to the waste-water treatment plant). He noted it was in close proximately to a man-box posing further risk to any mobile plant which may be used to move the man-box later. He informed the WOOD Crane Coordinator about the hazard. He contacted the Ampol Movement group and he organized a fence to be placed at the site of the soft edges and long grass near the culvert see photo 006.",,,,,,,,,"Normal Operations ",None,13712,13724,13726,20056197,11212,212,,,,,,Yes,2022-05-18 00:00:00.000,NULL,0,Wednesday,2022-05-18 05:22:14.000,No,,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CAIRS_Incidents.csv
