      "it was discovered that a person had not called into the control room for a task associated with another work order who was working under a permit. migrated from legacy cairs incident #39695at approx. 13:30 hours on friday the 31st of august it was reported by melbourne water that a scaffolder had not called in or out through the control room for the scaffolding work he had performed that day in the power station.the scaffolder was required to build a scaffold in order to perform work on the heat exchanger of engine 8 (work order no. 3687082). due to operational requirements to maintain a maximum number of engines running at all times, melbourne water do not shut an engine down to perform scaffold work. scaffolding is only performed on an opportune basis when an engine is shut down for servicing or if it has broken down, unless urgent.the scaffolder was first tasked with this job on the 14th of august and started the scaffold on this day, but it was left incomplete as the engine was required in service again before completion. on the 14th the scaffolder completed a q4 tra (ra041074) without submitting the q4 request for permit as a permit is not required to complete scaffolding unless working under an isolation. he did not work under an isolation and worked solo. his belief is that he can work building a scaffold around an engine if the engine is shut down and it does not necessarily have to be isolated. on this day the scaffolder did call in to the control room to advise he had started the job and again called in to advise job complete. see copy of control room log for 14th august 2018.before the change to melbourne waters permit process, now called control of work, the scaffolder would apply for a permit to perform the same task. the day before the 31st, the scaffolder was asked to work again on the engine 8 scaffold as a 1500 hour service was planned and the engine would be shut down (work order no. wo3687409). the scaffolders team leader had advised him other work groups would be working on engine 8. work order 3687082 for the heat exchanger scaffold does not appear on the control room log sheet as work for the 31st.a separate pre-start meeting is held every day by the personnel who normally work in the power station. the scaffolder did not attend this meeting, but his team leader did.on the 31st the scaffolder was to work with another person. the scaffolder explained the task to the other person in the maintenance building and they proceeded to the scaffold yard to get required equipment. the scaffolder checked with the mechanical crew member at approx. 08:00 if they were working on engine 8 and it was confirmed they were. at approx. 0900 before starting work the scaffolder got the 2nd person to check and sign onto the q4 tra he had completed on the 14th. they then entered the power station and started work on the scaffold around engine 8. the scaffolder stated he did not sign onto the permit for the 1500 hr service as it did not include his scaffold work scope.the scaffolder stated during his interview that he did not call in to the control room as the other work group were working under a permit on engine 8 and he knew they had to be recorded as part of their permit. he relied upon this. the mechanical and electrical personnel were aware of each other and the two scaffolders who were working on engine 8. the mechanical and electrical personnel did not ask the scaffolders to sign on their permit under the isolation.the mechanical and electrical work scopes performing the 1500hr service had both signed onto the permit taken out by the electrician.at approx. 11:00hrs the scaffolders were advised that engine 8 was going to be restarted after lunch. so they worked till approx. 11:30 before lunch time and left the power station. they did not call the control room, again relying on the work ceasing to be communicated by the other work group under permit.investigators observations post incident:· the scaffolder had had a previous experience when he had called to sign out of a work area with the control room. in that instance the control room had already signed the job off because they had only one line to record all the works on for the one work order number. another person had already called in. this led to his belief that if someone else had already called in, he would not need to.· during investigation of the incident at 15:25, the control room log for the 31st of august did only have one line allocated to the work order number for the 1500hr service. the name recorded was incorrect, not corrected to the person holding the permit and did not show that the workers allocated had already called in and signed off. this was corrected.· from interviews and discussions, there does appear to be a level of confusion associated with the management of simops/area monitoring for non-permitted work post the control of work introduction from mw staff and wood personnel. there is evidence of multiple occasions where personnel have forgotten to call in, call out and failures to follow up when personnel appear to be still working on site after hours. migrated from

      "3 wgis scaffolders whilst modifying scaffold framework on a weld habitat received a minor electric shock from ongoing ‘works’ in an adjoining bay on a common section of steelwork. migrated from legacy cairs incident #38251on the 19th of june 2018 at 10:55 a wood employee touched a galvanised steel scaffold frame they were working on (habitat ht6) and felt what they thought was an electrical source. this employee alerted the two other wood scaffolders who were in the same habitat. two of the scaffolders were able to make their way down from the scaffold and onto the concrete ground level. the 3rd scaffolder, using their voltage detector, detected voltage so remained in situ without moving. the two wood employees that had managed to step off the scaffold habitat summoned assistance from their supervisor and harland &amp; wolff personnel wood supervision and h&amp;w personnel arrived at habitat ht 6 at approximately 11:05; it became apparent that the only electrical supply that was energised at the time was a stork heating unit, identification number trn492. the heating unit was de-energised, the remaining scaffolder on habitat ht6 then detected no voltage on the scaffold and safely made their way to ground.personnel began an initial investigation to identify the exact source of the voltage, this involved re-energising heating unit trn492. at this point a voltage of 26vac was measured on habitat ht6. heating unit trn492 was then isolated and the voltage detected on habitat ht6 ceased. the 400v supply to heating unit trn492 was removed and connected to another stork heating unit (along with the output connections to the stork heat pads). this replacement heating unit was energised – there was zero voltage detected on habitat ht6. the 400v supply was then disconnected from the replacement heating unit and again re-connected to trn492; the output to the same heat pads was re-connected and trn492 re-energised. again, a voltage of 26vac was measured on habitat ht6. the investigation team identified that there was clearly an issue with trn492 so removed it from service and placed it into quarantine. stork’s on-site electrical team immediately began a series of tests and identified an issue with one of the programmers on channel 1 of trn492 which had been supplying the heat pads located in habitat ht5. it is noteworthy that the 400v cable supplying trn 492 had been replaced the week prior to this incident occurring.detailed investigation report attached migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n",

      "portvac unit damage due to high winds.severity - nil no actual harm sustainedpotential - low, unit came to rest on it's side. incident happened during nightshift, low numbers of personnel on site.investigation on-going migrated from legacy cairs incident #37867on the 23rd of april 2018 wis industrial painting had been carrying out grit blasting operations for the client sse. the project had been to mechanically blast and paint the internal steel structure of the hydro stations penstock pipelines, these are the pipelines that bring water from the reservoirs into the power stations turbines as part of creating the hydro electric process.as apart of a rejuvenation project to the hydro station on the night shift of the 23/04/2018 the wis team had been carrying out the removal of the spent grit waste to which accumulates during the daily blasting activities. this is done by using anindustrial portvac vacuum system which would be deployed external through long lengths of hose line to the internals of the pipelines. the extraction system of the portvac wouldextract through pressure thewaste grit in similar fashion as a hoover would pick up dirt.on the night of the incident the portvac unit had been situated as requested by the client at the rear of the powerstation. the power station's location sits within the loch banks and canhave particular high winds weather dependent, in conjunction with the location the stationalso sits within the face of the mountain range almost cut into the rock face. this means that any wind dissipating from the loch will be directed towards the powerstation and deflected up the rock face.the road leading from the entrance to the rear of the stationhadeffectively become a wind tunnel on the night of the incident.the portvac unit configuration is that of a fabricated steel box which sits on removable stilted legs where it can be lowered to suit certain height dimensions and for transport purposes. the unit weight standing alone would be that of 1400kg, dependent on the extraction operations normally a 1.25ton bag will be attached to unit as and when extraction of spent grit is taking place. the point of vulnerability is during the change out process of the bags where the unit will be freestanding to its own self weight along with the high sided design and the wind factor on the night of the incident the wind strengths have been enough to tip the unit onto its side, due to the close proximity of the rock face the unit did not completely fall over to the ground but came to rest against the side of the rock face causing structural damage to the unit. no personnel were harmed during the incident and the potential for harm was greatly reduced due to nightshift operations having limited numbers on site. as preventative measures the unit is now weighted down with 2- 1.25 ton grit bags anchored to either side of the portvac unit with ratchet straps. this means the unit is now securely anchored during the bag change out process. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n",

      "neck muscle strain handling scaffold component migrated from legacy cairs incident #37829on 20th april 2018 a wood scaffolder strained a neck muscle as he was carrying out the final manoeuvres in the installation of a 11ft ladder beam at the gasoline tank t3402 on the mossmorran site................................................................the work environment at t3402 was a tight and restricted space, a steel platform and handrails with insufficient space for a second person to assist with the load. the 11ft beam, weighing 34kg was being lifted just above chest height to be located into its final position. the scaffolder looked at this task and he did not believe that the amount of stretching, twisting and strength were going to require a special technique or unusual strength to move it. he did this task and did not consider it could cause him any harm. to him, this task was just another routine manual handling task that he has to do as part of his normal working day. as the scaffolder made the final manoeuvre of the beam he felt a pain in his neck. he stopped what he was doing and reported the injury to his supervisor, he was taken to first aid as a precaution, but no treatment was given. post incident, the scaffolder was moving freely and described his injury as a slight muscle strain. the injury did not affect the scaffolders ability to conduct his normal work activities.................................................................wood scaffolders on the mossmorran site spend most of their time manually lifting and handling scaffolding material under a variety of conditions. the scope for eliminating the handling of loads in most scaffolding operations is very limited and in this instance there was no possibility of eliminating the task or lifting the beam mechanically. the beam was being installed to use as a lifting point in an area where a crane jib could not access. the scaffold structure was a design scaffold where a 11’ steel beam was specified as a lifting point in the design drawing. these 11’ steel beams weigh 34kg and have a high residual manual handling risk for scaffolders during installation. it was highlighted post incident by the scaffolder gangs that lighter aluminium scaffold beams are available on the market but never seen on design drawings where lifting points are being constructed.................................................................manual handling is an inherent part of the scaffolding trade and the scaffolders on the mossmorran site have become accustomed and normalised to lifting equipment manually on a daily basis. to minimise manual handling of scaffolding materials (tubes, boards, ladder beams, etc) efforts are made by the scaffolding gangs to place the materials on the ground as close as possible to the workface by the use of forklift / and pallet trucks, this reduces the carrying and travel distance at the worksite. manual handling of scaffolding materials is a risk assessed activity and is covered by 2 manual handling risk assessments, id no(s): fim scaffolding 01 &amp; fim scaffolding 02. these risk assessments cover erection / dismantle / modification of scaffolding structures involving lifting and carrying scaffold tubes, boards, and fittings that are located at the worksite. the manual handling risk assessments did not cover the manual handling of ladder beams.................................................................whilst it was not a contributing factor in this incident the investigation process highlighted a high level of manual handling of scaffolding materials from grade level to locations at height on the mossmorran site. in an average working day at mossmorran a scaffolding gang could typically handle several tonnes of materials from grade level to height. the nature of the job dictates that the wood scaffolders must be mentally alert to the inherent dangers of what can be a physically strenuous job.................................................................manual handling of scaffolding materials (tubes, boards, ladder beams, etc) from grade level to height should be considered during the planning and risk assessment process. as part of the investigation process it was highlighted that mechanical equipment (cranes, scissor lifts or hoists) is not being considered as an integral part of the scoping and preparation phase. cranes are often brought to site for a variety of non-scaffolding tasks but they are never utilised for lifting scaffolding materials from grade level to height. a combination of poor risk assessment / planning and underutilisation of cranes results in a high level of 'rope and wheel' useand 'chaining' or 'handballing' to raise and lower materials on the mossmorran site. 'rope and wheel' useand 'chaining' or 'handballing' is well known to be time consuming, it can cause fatigue and can significantly increase the likelihood of a manual handling injury during periods of over use................................................................. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n"

from legacy cairs incident #36625on the 14th of march 2018, a wood industrial services scaffolder working within the dsm facility at dalry, ayrshirewas observed by the clients building shift manager scaling the external face of a partially erected scaffold that was near completion.the scaffold had been erected internal of building 9 to allow the client to carry out maintenance work to process equipment that had malfunctioned. the individual had been at aheight ofapproximately 2 metres when observed by the client and had been wearing fall arrest equipment at the time of observation. confirmation of wither the individual had used his fall protection by clipping on when at height is still to be determined through further investigation.the individual is currently suspended from site and a full investigation is underway.executive summary wood industrial services (wis) had been carrying out scaffold operations for our client dsm nutritional who are a pharmaceutical company located in the west coast of scotland in the small town of dalry, ayrshire.on the 14th of march 2018 wis were carrying out scaffold alteration works to an erected scaffold located within building 9 mezzanine level 2 column 200. the purpose of the alteration had been to give access to a blocked section of process tank /pipework which had currently broken-down and had stopped production of the client’s product. the scaffold in question had been a tube and fitting scaffold erected at approximately 2m x 1.4m x 4m high to the underside of tank 31-19000 to allow for client access. this had been erected on the previous nightshift (13th of march 2018) as requested by the client. on the morning of the 14th of march wis scaffold supervisor stuart dasilva (sd) had been informed by the client that the scaffold did not meet the required height for access by the clients maintenance team although the location of the scaffold had been erected as per client’s requirement from the previous days instructions. alteration works had then been required to correct the already erected scaffold. the wis scaffold team carrying out the task had been that of john austin wis charge hand (ja), donnie clarke wis scaffolder (dc) steven lyle, jamie mckernon wis scaffold labourer s (sl, jmc). the scaffold alterations commenced on the morning of the 14th of march 2018.sd briefed out the work instructions to the identified scaffold squad. the permit to work was signed onto and work began altering the scaffold. the immediate work area had been extremely congested with process pipework, cable trays, and structural steel work and as such access was limited. this is classed as normal conditions within the dsm facility and as a result there had been no formal issues raised by the scaffold team to wis supervision. further supervisory checks were carried out by sd at approximately 10am where works were progressing in a safe manner with the scaffolders working on a fully boarded handrailed platform. at approximately 11am sd was visited by the building 9 shift manager ian hoynes (ih) to which ih reported he had observed a wis scaffolder carrying out an unsafe act and asked for sd to have a word with the scaffolder. there had been no intervention carried out by ih at the time of witnessing the ua as he felt this could distract the individual and possibly cause a fall. ih informed sd that he witnessed the scaffolder in question donnie clarke (dc) scale the external face of the erected scaffold to which he accessed the boarded lift. the external face of the scaffold was positioned directly beside a stair well access point which led to a possibility of a non-direct fall of 4 metres diagonally down the stairwell. there had been a safe access point already created as part of the initial scaffold erection therefore the unsafe act carried out by dc was a breach of the nasc access /egress best practice guidance sg4:15 and failure to report to his employer any activity or defect relating to work at height which he knows is likely to endanger the safety of himself or others as per the working at height regulations 2005 duties of persons at work section 14 para 1.there had been no injury sustained at the time of the incident and dc had informed his management team that he had used his fall protection harness by clipping on to the scaffold structure as and when he accessed the outside of the scaffold. the operative in question has been suspended as per company policy during the ongoing incident investigation. summary of investigationfindingsthe immediate cause was as follows: operative non-compliant to sg4:15 procedures while climbing external of scaffold framework.the root cause was as follows:rc1.behaviours of individual involvedrc2.risk assessment and method statement deficienciesrc3. scaffold layout changed from original design with no or non-effective change control. the immediate actions taken were:operatives stood down from task - investigation started summary of longer term sustainable actions:review of current working at height / sg4:15 training onsiteensure risk assessments and methods of work are detailed and specific to the task at hand.review management of change where scaffold modifications are required and ensure suitably erected to allow safe access / egress to carryout erection / dismantle and modification operations.incident descriptionon the 14th of march 2018 wis were carrying out scaffold alteration works to an erected scaffold located within building 9 mezzanine level 2 column 200. the purpose of the alteration had been to give access to a blocked section of process tank /pipework which had currently broken-down and had stopped production of the client’s product.the scaffold had been erected by the previous nightshift squad as per the requirements of the clients nightshift team however there had been a lack of communication by the client’s maintenance team as to the exact location the scaffold was required for. this in turn meant that the affected area for maintenance could not be reached by the scaffold in place.alteration works began after a request from the building shift manager to which wis prepared a risk assessment/ method statement for the task at hand and a permit to work was created and authorised. the scaffolding squad had been made up of 4 scaffolders being charge hand john austin, scaffolder donnie clarke and scaffold labouruer steven lyle and jamie mckernon, they were briefed on the workscope by stuart dasilva wis scaffold supervisor.nearing point of completion there had been a remaining toe board and handrail protection to be erected, the scaffold charge hand left the workface at this point to prepare scaffold material for another job and was not present at the time of the unsafe act. donnie clarke was then observed by the client’s building shift manager ian hoynes climbing into the scaffold platform from the external face of the scaffold. the statement given by the shift manager ian hoynes stated that dc didn’t appear to be hooked on at this time but that he could not confirm 100% to this . no further intervention was made by ih and the scaffolder carried on with his task.as part of the investigation the standing scaffold had been erected as per sg4:15 access and egress with an access ladder erected on the opposite side of where dc was observed. this access point onto the working platform and through to the point of work location had been noted to be extremely congested with process pipework, cable trays and obstructions limiting the operative’s maneuverability. dc felt that due to the restrictive nature of the access point and as detailed within his witness statement, felt that he could get stuck while trying to get through to his work location. dc took it upon himself to identify an area on the scaffold which looked easier to access and began to scale the outside of the scaffold at a height of approximately 2 metres, this particular area had also been directly above a staircase which accessed down 4metres to another level. dc confirmed in his statement that he hooked on at all times during the scaling of the scaffold and thought what he was doing was fine. dc had stated that he felt pressure to get the job finished as a number of client operatives had been asking when they could get onto the scaffold as the breakdown had shut the clients production down. at this point dc should have stopped the job and reported the issues to his supervisors where better access could have been reviewed for finishing the job.the scaffold in question had still been under construction therefore as per sg4:15 personal fall protection would still have been required at some point in the system of work as the scaffolders safe zone does not completely eliminate the risk of a fall for all scaffolding operations. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n",

      "4'x4' unsecured panel flew over persons head in high winds. no contact was made. migrated from legacy cairs incident #36424when walking towards the south crane pedestal a 4'x4' panel from a crate flew through the air narrowly missing person. the item landed on the walkway. it is believed to have come from the tote deck.person advised the safety officer. person then went to the tote deck and found other sheets and containers loose. person secured these items to make the area safe.awaiting total investigation report.update 15/05/2018:the investigation found that a pallet lid travelled from the tote deck to the weather deck during extremely high winds. it is believed the pallet lid was nailed down when sent to the elgin puq. the pallet was opened to check the contents and then nailed closed again. however, the same holes were used to nail the lid closed the second time. using the same holes again meant that the hole was slightly larger and the nails did not have enough grip to remain secure during high winds. the wind then managed to detach the lid which travelled to the deck below.as immediate improvement actions we have expedited the removal of some materials from the platform reducing the amount of pallets we have on board. every other pallet remaining has the lid secured by a ratchet straps providing positive securing and an easy visible indication. the longer term solution we are working through supply chain is that all removable lids will need a method of positive securing (latch/ clasp type arrangement). migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n",

      "employee was observed working at height without fall protection. migrated from legacy cairs incident #3638802 feb 2018 a hexagon employee was observed on top of m50 gt-b roll out table/ skid not wearing fall protection. the potential risk was for the employee to fall to m50 deck which is 1.4 meters and/ or to the main deck which is 6.6 meters from the top of the table/ skid. the employee was on the top of the table/ skid for a short period of time; his supervisor did not want to shout from the main deck to avoid distracting him. after theemployee was safely back on the on deck the supervisor shouted asking him where his harness was and why he was not hooked on. the supervisor signalled him to stop the job and approached him to explain the hazards and concerns. the job was stopped and a time out for safety was called with all 4 team members to highlight the seriousness of this high potential incident and to remind them about the risk of being removed from the facility as per a previous incident that occurred with a subcontractor. a follow up safety stand down was called and the incident was discussed with the oim, maintenance supervisors, safety officer and the team members.based on the employee’s statement, he decided to climb up to remove the shackle as part of housekeeping. the employee chose not to wear his fall protection as it would have taken longer to reach up to the slings and connect his fall arrestor than it would to climb up and remove the shackle without protection. the initial investigation revealed that a safety harness was on site and 2x slings secured to the structure for connecting the fall arrestor. this indicated the need for increasing awareness and need for using fall protection.03-feb-2018detailed investigation is ongoing.08-feb-2018it has been agreed by the fpso oim, client hse manager and in-country hexagon management the following:the hexagon employee will travel back onshore to conduct kteg golden rules refresher training, this will be augmented by woods lsr information. this will include a practical element assessment to identify the suitable lanyard and fall prevention equipment in various working at height scenarios; on a ladder, scaffolding, similar situation to where the incident occurred.once the training has been completed, employee will be required to prepare a working at height training course (presentation attached)based on the training that he has gone through onshore. the employee will travel back offshore to complete his rotation, he will be required to present his training package to the on board fpso personnel.the employee will travel back offshore 13 feb 2018. before he travels offshore the wood safety cocoon package will be re-rolled out to the employee.12 feb 2018the just and fair culture - decision tree has been reviewed and followed.it has been agreed that the employee's action was a'personnel opportunistic violation' - the employee varied from the wood and kt procedure to make it easier for themselves i.e. taking less time to remove the shackle without wearing the required and detailed fall protection equipment.formal disciplinary action has been considered and will be discussed with the employee by the in-country hexagon operations manager prior to the employee returning offshore 13-feb-2018.during the investigation is was identified that the onsite supervisor (lead mechanic) did instruct the employee to remove the lifting and hoisting equipment as per the agreed plan, which included wearing the detailed working at height fall arrest equipment. however at the time of the incident the onsite supervisor did not witness the employee violating the working at height procedure. it was in fact the passing maintenance supervisor who witnesses the employee working at height without the required fall protection. thus leading to the decision that the lead mechanic does not require formal disciplinary action. the lead mechanic was involved in the time out for safety and the investigation process. 13-feb-2018additional information received from the fpso maintenance supervisor:the roll out table was still in progress of being constructed and was not yet a free open working area.the use of harness’s was requested by the maintenance supervisor and hook in points installed (as they were) to be used. in additional to support this, scaffolders were asked to install a hard scaffold barrier inboard on the m50 process deck area, preventing any personnel not involved with the construction of the roll out table passing into this area by accident. the hard barrier was and still is fitted between the handrail and m50 gtb booster pump skid.the hexagon employee involved with the incident was inside his own hard barrier controlled area as a work party team member. he was working under a permit for the task of constructing the roll out table and he had been involved in all tbt’s, permit conversations, planning and instruction for this task to be completed safely. 19-feb-2018confirmation email and attendance sheets were sent from fpso safety officer for the 4 safety meetings the employee presented their presentation at.feedback given from the offshore management team was that the employee did a great job presenting and the material he had put together was very detailed and of high quality.hip - 14th februaryproduction - 17th februarymarine - 18th februarymaintenance - 18th february27-feb-2018irp was held with africa hse manager, hexagon country manager, hexagon kteg operations manager and hexagon hse advisor.the presentation was reviewed and comments made. the changes to the irp presentation were made and the updated presentation was sent to all personnel mentioned above 28-feb-2018.the africa hse manager is to review the updated presentation with europe &amp;

      "cctv camera guide rope broke during retrieval of camera. migrated from legacy cairs incident #36316this investigation was completed by the wood. sub-contractor rangedale drainage services where it was reported arope they were using broke whilsttrying to pulla cameraupstream against the flow. the sub-contractorinvestigation uncovered the following:-normally the rope is not retrieved by pulling it upstream as the rope is used to steady the float within the pipe as it surveys downstream. on this particular night we had the system being repaired since before christmas and it was returned to us twice and was not operating correctly even though it had been tested by them and us before going to sight, this night again it was working prior to getting it into the pipe and as soon as we were ready to put it into the flow the communications dropped out again on the system. this meant pulling the float system out and then having to retrieve the rope by pulling it upstream. the tension created by the flow of the water on the rope is quite a lot and during the early stages of this process the rope has caught on something in the pipe which has caused it to snap. we use a 6mm rope specifically so that it floats on the surface and does not drag on the bottom of the pipe and risk getting caught on any debris or other snag point.some of the lessons learned identified included: a. to carry a length of heavier and stronger rope, of a minimum 8mm, with the crew on the basis that should this event occur again, operators can attach the stronger rope at the upstream manhole and allow the winch at the d/s manhole to roll up the lead rope as usual and then we would retrieve the heavier rope upstream. it can be never assured that a rope will not get caught on something in the pipe.b. we also will ensure that the ropes are replaced regularly and that ropes used are not more than 8 weeks old. whilst the ropes we use are polypropylene and do not rot or absorb water they can deteriorate with uv rays.c. we will also carry a more robust hook that in the event this happened again we would go several manhole lengths downstream and set a grappling hook in the line to catch the rope as it always bunches up.the sub-contractorbelieves that by putting these new measures in place we will be able to avoid any possibility of this occurring again. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n",

(all had been trained by nationwide in emergency mewp recovery).the previous day to the incident, (14/11/17) the team had parked up a 70ft mewp at the end of their shift on the starboard dockside of prince of wales. they had used the mewp all day and had left it in position to begin work the following morning from the same mewp.at approx. 9am the following morning (15/11/17) the same team went to retrieve the mewp to begin with their work activity, only to find that the mewp was no longer where they had left it the previous night. they contacted their supervisor (colin fraser) and explained the situation, colin explained that perhaps the mewp had been moved on the previous nightshift. colin stated , however, there was a 135ft mewp located on the port dockside the team could utilise. colin contacted speedy (onsite mewp suppliers) to visit the area and validate the mewp operators ipaf card, so he could start the machine. (this is a process at rosyth, where the operatoris required to have his ipaf card on him to operate the machines) his card was validated and the operator began to move the mewp slowly from its position on the port dockside, with the assistance of 2 banksmen.his location was to be the dockside starboard. during the transfer between port and starboard the mewp boom was spotted to have been extended over the main rd (keith road) at height to enable the operator to negotiate a tight angle and transverse onto the road.this was captured on cctv and only reported to onsite wood hse at approx. 5pm.the investigation has begun and is ongoing.urine samples taken from the 3 operatives involved for drug analysis. all 3 returned negative.upon viewing the footage, (16/11/17) supplied by the client it has been established that the 2 banksmen involved in ensuring the mewp was moved in a safe manner, failedin their duties. the boom of the mewp was captured to be exposed at height over the width of the road for approx 5mins. during this time it has been established that a number of site vehicles passed without incident under the boomand the banksmen did not attempt to stop the traffic to allow the mewp operator to manoeuvre the mewp to its intended location (stb side dock 1, a distance of approx 30/40mtrs). after a period of 10mins the mewp operator finally reached the starboard side without incident.after discussions and interviews with the 3 operatives, itwas also established that a similar incident occurred the previous day (14/11/17). the 3 man team were manoeuvring a 75ft mewp from the same locations on the dockside. again the mewp operator was exposed over the width of the road for approx 5 mins while his 2 banksmen failed in their duties to assist the operator. on both occasions the banksmen were spottedon cctv cameras standing on the kerbside of the road and not stopping the traffic while site traffic passed under the boom. it was also confirmed by the cctv cameras that the mewp operator had the foresight to lift his boom to a height where thepotential of avehicle striking the boom was eliminated. during the interview process, the banksman stated that they were approached by a babcock (client) manager and told they were holding up the traffic and could the mewp operator not lift his boom up to allow vehicles to pass under. this cannot be confirmed as the banskman could not provide any names. due to the blurry images of the cctv footage, the registrations of the vehicles which passed under the mewp boom could also not be established. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n",

strike on the d-annunzio location for petrohunt by field supervisor eli frisk.eli advised that they were trenching a fresh water 1” poly line from the well head of the d-annunzio to the noonan federal well head. eli stated that they had dug the trench and laid in the poly line and the tracer line into the trench and were about to backfill the ditch to about half the depth so that the electricians the next day would be able to use the same ditch and lay in electrical line, when they noticed that the d-annunzio was not operating. eli stated at that time they went to the power box behind the unit. he then noticed that the unit had no power going to it. eli stated that through a investigation of the area they noticed that the 480v electrical line had a sharp bend/kink to it and what appeared to him as a burn mark on the outside cover of the line. at that point eli stopped the job and notified petrohunt company man, wood group safety and eli’s direct supervisor.upon arrival wood group and eli’s direct supervisor met with eli and austin and discussed the incident. eli and austin covered the jsa before proceeding to the incident area. safety was also advised by petrohunt company man and petrohunt electrician that he was to lock out the main breaker and that the electricians would be out in the morning to repair the line. eli and austin then proceeded to show the incident area to safety and his supervisor. safety took pictures of the area and began investigation of the area. eli stated that the hydrovac had exposed both the electrical line that was struck and the gas sales line that comes off the well head of the d-annunzio. eli stated that he had the hydrovac run a 25’ trench approximately 3’ deep to find the electric line. the initial locate company marked on the ground indicating the electric lines location but the hydrovac did not find it in that area. this is why eli took it upon himself to tell the hydrovac crew to continue to hydrovac until it was found as he knew it ran across at some point in the area he was going to dig. safety could see in the edges of the trench the hydrovac had exposed the electrical line (located 3’ down from ground level) just wider than the trench width and that the depth of the hydrovac was about 6-8” below the electrical line. safety could see that there were bucket marks on the side of the ditch that shown that it was within the 2 foot allowable machine dig zone of the underground line. eli stated that he was parked on the south side of the line while digging. eli stated that he placed his bucket on the north side of the line and began to dig out the dirt under the line so that he could get the trench to the required 6 foot. eli stated that he would place his bucket flat and pull his bucket on the ground towards his machine. when the backhoe boom would get close to the electric line he would stop the motion and then curl the bucket up to help break the material up and drop falling dirt into the backhoe bucket. eli then would lay bucket back flat on the floor of the trench and push it away from his machine so that he could place the dirt on the spoil pile. once dirt had been pushed from under the line towards the machine eli then placed his bucket into the trench but on the south side of the line. eli stated he placed the teeth on the bottom of the trench and began to pull toward the machine and when doing so would curl the bucket up so that the bucket would again become flat so he could continue to clean the ditch. safety asked austin his role as spotter what he was watching. austin stated that during the digging operations he was watching the front part of the bucket where the teeth were located as to ensure a safe dig was maintained and was positioned on the west side of the trench. safety stated that the direction of the line showing that it shown from the damage that it was pushed to the north. safety, eli’s supervisor, eli and austin all agreed that when the bucket was curled and pulled toward the machine while located on the south side of the line, that the damage came from the back portion of the backhoe bucket. eli stated that they did not at that were aware that they had struck the line and that they continued to work. they both stated that no audible or visual indicators arose when they were in that area when the work was being performed.safety advised eli and austin that he would need them to write up statements for him and drop them off in the morning.a round table discussion was held on the morning of 13 oct. 2017 to discuss the incident. the investigation and root cause investigation shown that elkhorn policies were not followed for digging near and around underground utilities. policy states:” elkhorn policy, we will not use mechanical means of excavation within 24” of any utility”. stop work authority was not taken as to prevent digging closer than 2 feet from the utility. additional causes are pressure from oil company to finish the job each day, which resulted in the crew trying complete the work.district leaders also agreed that all supervisors will get with crews under them and cover/refresh on elkhorn excavation policies, loto policies, stop work authority policies and have all workers sign off stating that they attended and understand the policies.also discussed was using resources on hand to assist with operator refresher training and also to be used to measure operator proficiencies while operating the equipment near underground utilities.on 13 oct 2017 safety was advised by district 17 project manager who went back out to the location to do a follow up and ensure the line was repaired and meet with the crews and discuss the incident. the electricians stated that the second 480v line that was next to the live line was in fact a dead line and no longer in service. the damaged found inside the struck line shown that the “control line” was pushed in a manner causing it to come in contact with one of the 240v lines inside the main line which caused the arch out of the main cover insulation. the pictures attached are labeled a-1 thru a-13a-1 is a northern facing view of the trench from the

      "marked line strike - no injuries sustained migrated from legacy cairs incident #34488today we were notified by project superintendent, that eo (equipment operator) and swamper made contact with a 3\" marked gas line. no injuries were sustained. eo and swamper were tasked to excavate a ditch using a trackhoe heading south to north with 4 marked line crossings. both eo and swamper had previously dug and crossed the same lines 4 days prior, approximately 10' to the west, all the lines were potholed to identify depth. once they reached their final 3\" gas line crossing, the swamper went to the center of the ditch and attempted to use a probe to break the dirt and hand dig the line but the dirt was too hard so he went over to the west side of the ditch and was successful on probing the line to verify depth and hand dug with a shovel to expose the line on the west side of the ditch. eo and swamper coordinated that eo would take off approximately 18\" off the top since the line was 5' in depth to the top of the pipe then undermine the line so rest would slough off to hand dig and successfully cross the line. as the eo went under the line he rolled the bucket away from the line and made contact with the line, causing a small hole on the bottom of the line. the client is the owner of the damaged line and stated that the 3\" line was under 100 psi of gas and went to a dead leg from a tank battery that was recently eliminated. when contact was made the eo, swamper, and client inspector immediately shut off ignition sources and proceeded upwind to make the proper notifications. the line was immediately shut down and vented out, by the client. line blew down in approximately 10 minutes at a very low pressure. client has stated that the line is scheduled to be abandoned and removed, and are scheduling for elkhorn pipeline service to perform the task. the line will remain shut down until we abandon it. both eo and swamper have successfully performed over 25 line crossings on this project alone. preliminary investigation has revealed that complacency may have been a factor resulting in the line strike. although the same eo and swamper had successfully crossed this same line days prior, additional precautions of fully hand digging the line may have been an alternate route to ensure that the 2' distance away from known lines rule was not breached. both the eo and swamper will not participate in excavation operations for the following two days. both employees will be retrained on excavating on, or near, underground utilities before being put back to any type of underground work. findings of further investigation and cairs report to follow. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n",

      "additional breathing air quality check not complete on setup migrated from legacy cairs incident #34508as part of the safe system of work for undertaking grit blasting activities additional checks of the air quality being supplied to the blast hood were not complete on initial set up. the system in use had a fully signed up written scheme of examination for the blast and equipment set up. immediate corrective action has been taken to assess all other similar set ups tor set by client: 1) is the procedure for testing of zander unit air quality specific in frequency, competence, test equipment, pass/fail criteria? 2) is the procedure fully understood by those signing off the blast set-up as safe to use? 3) are there record sheets for quality test results? 4) what are the occupational health limits for air quality delivered by zander unit and are these fully understood by all personal involved in blast unit set-up and usage? 5) are there medical tests for blasters who wear the blasting mask with air delivered by zander unit with usage levels per day? do we comply? 6) for the set-up in question with suspicion of the air quality being delivered , please provide an actual set of readings from the set-up and confirm these provide no threat to health confirmed by wg occupational health.executive summary the potential source of the respiratory chest infection is extremely difficult to pinpoint. but based on information from the air quality tests, the inspection of the filters, and lack of smell/odours/moisture within the blast hoodduring the work activity, it would seem unlikely that the compressed air system used during the blast activity would be the source, even with high moisture content. chest infections are usually caused by viruses and bacteria which are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, a compressed air system used for breathing air quality would not normally be considered a source of a respiratory chest infection. the chest infection reported by the blaster has been classified as not work related. to be classified as work related there has to be conclusive evidence that the injury or illness is directly linked to work activities – this has not been possible with any level of assurance in this case. whilst there has been no clear link identified between the blasting activity and the illness the opportunity has been taken to highlight improvements in the management of blast equipment setups and air quality testing on site.investigation findings and conclusions  1) is the procedure for testing of zander unit air quality specific in frequency, competence, test equipment, pass/fail criteria? procedure - yes, there is a wgis process for testing compressed air quality but it is not being implemented on site. this process for testing air quality is detailed within wgis procedure (sp24 respiratory protective equipment). frequency - breathing air quality checks should be carried out:- initial equipment set up – before first use, after a compressor has been changed out, after compressor maintenance, after a compressor has been moved even if it has only been moved a short distance, if an end user expresses any concerns, as a requirement of the job specific ra, where the quality of the breathing air is suspected as being below the required standard, where an item of the supply circuit such as hoses and filters has been changed out or repaired, client insistence, every 3 months. competence - air quality checks must be carried out by a competent person on set up. there was no one trained to use the test equipment on site. some air quality testing prior to december 2016 had been carried out by the wgis hse advisor but this task was not being carried out by anyone on site when he moved to another wgis contract. the paint team on site were aware that the previous hse advisor used to do these checks but no one from the paint team had raised any concerns that it was no longer being carried out since his departure. test equipment - the equipment used by wgis to test compressed air quality is the drager aerotest alpha. the test equipment was eventually found in the shell laboratory where it had been stored for an estimated 12 month period. wgis purchased a kit for mossmorran site in dec 2013 and it was issued to the advisor on site at that time. pass/fail criteria - breathing air quality is to meet the recommendations of bs en 12021.  contaminant maximum permitted levelcarbon monoxide (co)= 5 ppmcarbon dioxide (co2)= 500 ppmoil= 0.5 mg/m3water= 250 mg/m3odour / tasteno significant odour or taste 2) is the procedure fully understood by those signing off the blast set-up as safe to use? wgis have 5 employees on site who are trained and competent to set up and verify blast set ups as per the written scheme of examinations (wse). training was conducted on 11/06/2015, certified as being competent on site are kevin mcdougall, david simmonds, steven mcneish, lee thomson &amp; andy lambie. only these individuals sign off wse set ups. the wse procedure is in place to satisfy the requirements of the pressure systems safety regulations (pssr), and as such, focuses on the pressure elements of the set up. it does not currently include any requirement to conduct air quality checks as these requirements are detailed within sp24. the permit does not include any reference to air quality checks of compressed air. 3)are there record sheets for quality test results? as per wgis procedure sp24 records of air quality checks should be kept for 5 years. it is known that some air quality testing has been carried out prior to december 2016 but historical records of air quality checks could not be located during the investigation process. wgis form (qr128 compressed air breathing air quality check – aerotest alpha kit) should be used to record all checks. 4)what are the occupational health limits for air quality delivered by zander unit and are these fully understood by all personal involved in blast unit set-up and usage? all personnel involved are aware how the niltox filters work. the niltox purifiers are contained in sealed cartridges and contain the colour change monitor, these are monitored by the site team. no concerns were raised by the site team about the condition of the filters in use. 5)are there medical tests for blasters who wear the blasting mask with air delivered by zander unit with usage levels per day? do we comply? medical tests for blasters are conducted at site annually. the blaster has completed a site medical at mossmorran on 30th march 2017, during the medical the blaster had a lung function test carried out. results were poor though not significantly different from 2015. on the blasters completed occupational health questionnaire he had indicated that he had suffered from pneumonia within the last 3 years . following the assessment, the nurse did not advise for any adjustments to be made to the blasters role and he is presently deemed fit to wear an air fed blast hood. there are no specified usage levels per day for blasters wearing air fed blast hoods. the blasters are advised to alter their work rate according to their own capabilities, rest periods during blasting are taken as per the blasters requirements. this is monitored and enforced by supervision. 6)for the set-up in question with suspicion of the air quality being delivered, please provide an actual set of readings from the set-up and confirm these provide no threat to health confirmed by wg occupational health. when the blast activities were being undertaken on 17th &amp; 18th august 2017 the blaster did not report any issues or concerns relating to excessive moisture, water or smells within his blast hood. he completed the task on both days without stopping work or raising any concerns about the breathing air being provided. an air quality test of the set up being used could not be undertaken in its exact location (t-3401 area) due to elapsed time from the blasting activity being undertaken (17th &amp; 18th august 2017), and the blaster reporting his chest infection (24th august). the equipment by thursday 24th august had been dismantled and taken away from the t-3401 area. in order to get a comparable air quality test the exact same equipment was set up in the yard at silverstone stores. a test was conducted on monday 28th august. these tests confirmed that, carbon monoxide (co), carbon dioxide (co2) and oil mist were below the recommended levels, confirming air being provided through the equipment and filter unit being used was not potentially contaminated. it is difficult to ascertain the exact water vapour level from the test conducted on monday 28th august as the wrong drager tube was used for testing. drager tube: water vapour 1/b (part no. 81 01 781) was used instead of drager tube: water vapour 20/a-p (part no. 81 03 061). the tube during the test went off the scale within 2 minutes but this was due to the wrong tube being used. a visual inspection of the filters confirmed that the colour change strips were within the recommended scale for safe use (one had a full blue line and the other had some pink discolouration below the recommended change line). there were no unusual odours, mould or growth evident on any of the filters. there was some indication of potential slight contamination (oil or moisture) on the tip of the colour change strips, but this is not unusual. a wgis occupational hygienist consulted during the investigation states that the presence of moisture within a compressed line for breathing air quality does not represent an immediate risk to health, whereas the presence of co, co2 or oil mist above certain levels would. the wgis occupational hygienist stated that moisture is more of an issue operationally e.g. moisture in a line can lead to issues with freezing (if certain temperatures are reached), which could in certain conditions lead to line fractures and thus loss of air. moisture also has the potential for rust to occur. so a visual check at major connections points, threads, tappings, inside filters cartridges would indicate if rust was occurring. excessive moisture/condensation can lead to microbiological growth, if conditions are good (e.g. correct temperature, food availability etc). this would be rare within a compressed air system though and would be more relevant with standing water. migrated from legacy cairs - see detailed description\n",
